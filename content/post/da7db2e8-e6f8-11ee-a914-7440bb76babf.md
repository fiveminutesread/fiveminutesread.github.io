# Poland's 'Heart of the Garden' named tree of 2024

The tree in Wrexham, Wales, is the third in a row to win.
The tree is estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 years old.
The other two trees are in Normandy and Sardinia.
The winner will be announced at a ceremony later this month.

Giant tree survived being pillaged for firewood in 1940s post-war Britain.
Thought to be almost 500 years old, this giant tree has weathered many storms.
The full results can be seen on Europe<bb>#39;s tTree of the Year website.

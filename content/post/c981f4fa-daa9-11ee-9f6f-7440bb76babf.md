# Top court says states can't ban Trump from ballots

Colorado had barred Mr Trump from its Republican primary, arguing he incited the 2021 Capitol riot.
The court ruled that only Congress, rather than the states, has that power.
Mr Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination and looks likely to face a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in November.
Mr Trump said the decision was 'very well crafted' and will bring the country together.

He said: 'You can<bb>'t take someone out of a race because an opponent would like it that way,<bb>" Mr Trump added.
He was speaking from his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, soon afterwards.
Maine and Illinois had followed Colorado in kicking Mr Trump off the ballot on similar grounds.
The efforts in both those states were put on hold while his challenge to the Colorado ruling was escalated to the Supreme Court.

The watchdog group that brought the case in Colorado, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), said in a statement that while the court <bb>"failed to meet the moment, it is still a win for democracy.
Part of the Civil War-era amendment bars federal, state and military officials who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the US from holding office again.
But states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Sections 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency.
Free Speech For People had argued that the attempt to delay the peaceful transfer of power on 6 January 2021 matched the definition of insurrection.

The court<bb>'s three liberal justices argued that the ruling seeks to <bb>"decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and [Trump] from future controversy.
They said the majority shuts the door on other potential means of enforcement.
A law professor at Case Western Reserve University said the ruling may have far-reaching consequences.
The decision effectively ensures that the question of the former president<bb>'s constitutional eligibility under Section 3 will not be resolved prior to the 2024 election.

The decision throws the problem to Congress at a time when partisan deadlock will guarantee inaction on this matter,<bb>" Mr Ellis added.
The former president is widely expected to sweep the board and defeat his sole remaining opponent, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, in every battleground.
He is expected to be re-elected with a majority of more than 60 per cent of the vote.
The next election will be held on November 6.

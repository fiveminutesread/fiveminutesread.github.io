# London landmarks join Earth Hour lights switch-off

The annual Earth Hour, spearheaded by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), is observed around the world.
Previous years have seen Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, and the Sydney Opera House turn out the lights.
WWF suggests individuals use the 60 minutes, between 20:30 and 21:30, to do something positive for the planet.
Lit-up landmarks that will go dark for the hour include the Barbican Arts Centre, the Old Bailey, Tower Bridge, and the OXO Tower.

WWF published its 2024 manifesto earlier this month, calling on MPs to take urgent political action on biodiversity loss and the environment.
The UK must ensure the country<bb>#39;s net carbon account for the year 2050 is net zero - at least 100% lower than the 1990 baseline.
The UK government has committed to urgent international action to tackle climate change.

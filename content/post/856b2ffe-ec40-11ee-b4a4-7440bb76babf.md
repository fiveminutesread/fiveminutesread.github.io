# Top streamer Ninja diagnosed with cancer at 32

The 32-year-old Fortnite gamer said a mole removed from his foot was found to be cancerous.  He is urging others to get regular check-ups.  Ninja has become synonymous with Twitch since his return to the streaming site in 2020, following a brief stint with Microsoft<bb>'s rival platform Mixer.

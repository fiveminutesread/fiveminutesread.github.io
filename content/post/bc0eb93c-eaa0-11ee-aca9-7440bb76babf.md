# Indians celebrate Holi - the festival of colours

Millions of Indians are celebrating Holi, known as the festival of colours.
The festival celebrates the beginning of spring and the victory of good over evil.
It is based on the Hindu legend of Holika, a female demon, who tries to kill her nephew Prahlad because he worships the Hindu god Vishnu.
Holi is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India.

Huge processions are held in several parts of the country to mark the festival.
A public holiday is observed and schools are shut as children and adults devote the day to colourful celebrations.
The festival is also celebrated in the neighbouring country of Nepal.

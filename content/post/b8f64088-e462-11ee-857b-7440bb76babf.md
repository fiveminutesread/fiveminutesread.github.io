# More arrests over alleged assault on black pupil

Four boys have now been arrested over the alleged attack in the Upperby area of Carlisle.
A video circulating online appears to show the student being pushed and punched by a white boy before being made to kiss his shoes.
One boy was arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated actual bodily harm in the early hours of Saturday.
Four boys, in their early teens, were from Carlisle and police patrols stepped up.

Three others arrested on suspicion of abetting racially aggravated actual bodily harm.
Police urge people not to share the video further so as not to impede any potential legal proceedings or to identify any of the children involved.

# Peace is not made with arms, says Pope in Easter plea

Pope Francis used his traditional Easter message to call for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and for the return of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
The 87-year-old pontiff led Easter Mass at the Vatican in front of thousands, despite concerns over his health.
Pope Francis also warned countries against re-arming themselves and spoke about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
Pope Francis was helped into a wheelchair as he greeted cardinals celebrating Easter Mass.

He then travelled around St Peter<bb>'s Square in the popemobile waving to large crowds.
The Pope skipped the traditional Way of the Cross ceremony and procession at Rome<bb>#38;s Colosseum to protect his health.
The Vatican said in November the Pope cancelled a planned trip to the COP28 climate summit in Dubai due to influenza and lung inflammation.
In March 2023 he was admitted to hospital with bronchitis and months later he underwent abdominal surgery on a hernia.

The Pope has been diagnosed with lung cancer.

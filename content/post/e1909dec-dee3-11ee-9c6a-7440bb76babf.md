# Stars gather for Oscars after huge year for cinema

Christopher Nolan <bb>'s Oppenheimer, which has 13 nominations, is expected to sweep up at the ceremony.
US television host Jimmy Kimmel will be presenting the awards from Los Angeles.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, based in Los Angeles, nominate and vote across more than 20 categories including best picture, best actor and best actress.
The Oscars is the pinnacle of achievement in the awards season calendar.

While film awards ceremonies including the Golden Globes and the Baftas attract plenty of attention, the Oscars are the most prestigious of the bunch.
The Oscars will be held on February 26, 2015.
The ceremony will be broadcast live on ABC.
Oscar nominations for best picture, best actor and best supporting actress announced.

Best director goes to Christopher Nolan for his work on The Dark Knight Rises.
Best picture goes to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug for the third time.
Best Director goes to Tom Hanks for his role in The Hobbit.
Best Picture goes to Ridley Scott for The Hobbit, which he directed.

Four out of five nominated directors this year are European.
Emma Stone is a frontrunner in the best actress race.
If Robert Downey Jr picks up the award for best supporting actor, it will also be a first Oscar win for him.
Chasing down Oppenheimer with 11 nods is Yorgos Lanthimos.

Killers of the Flower Moon, about the murder of members of the Osage Indian tribe by white settlers who are after their oil, scored 10 nominations in total.
If Gladstone triumphs - and it<bb>'s hard to call at this point - she will be the first Native American to win the award.
Barbie did land eight nods in total though, with America Ferrara and Ryan Gosling recognised in the best supporting actress and supporting actor categories respectively.
Barbie was nominated for eight awards, including best actress, best actress in a drama and best supporting actor.

She was also nominated for best animated film and best animated feature film.
All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize.
French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, romantic drama Past Lives, incisive satire American Fiction and chilling Nazi drama The Zone of Interest also in the running.
The race for best actress between Stone and Gladstone is too close to call, but could Gladstone's recent SAG win get her over the line?

Best actor is also up in the air with Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers) and Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) However, Murphy seems to have his nose in front following recent wins at Bafta and SAG.
However, Stone has the showier role as Poor Things<bb>' charming protagonist Bella Baxter.
If Daniel Day-Lewis wins, he will be the first Irish-born actor to triumph.
If Rustin Domingo wins, it will be first time two gay actors have been nominated for best actor in the same year.

There are people of colour in every acting category at this year's Oscars.
Justine Triet is only the eighth woman to be nominated for best director.
A record three films directed by women - Triet, Gerwig and Celine Song - are up for best picture.
Robbie Robertson could pick up a posthumous Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon.

Most of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet.
Presenters include Zendaya, Al Pacino, Lupita Nyong<bb>'o, Bad Bunny, Dwayne Johson, Regina King, Matthew McConaughey, Mahershala Ali and Michelle Pfeiffer.
US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel returns to hosting duties this year.
It will be his fourth time, including his stint at the helm last year.

Billie Eilish will also sing her Barbie track, What Was I Made For?

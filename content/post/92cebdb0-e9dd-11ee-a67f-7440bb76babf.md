# Briton 'overjoyed' at completing one of world's toughest races

Jasmin Paris from Midlothian completed the Barkley Marathons in Tennessee with just one minute 39 seconds to spare.
The course, at Frozen Head State Park, changes every year but covers 100 miles involving 60,000ft of climb and descent.
Only 20 people have ever made it to the end of the race within the allotted 60 hours.
Jasmin lost her voice from heavy breathing during the race.

Pictures at the race finish line show her legs scratched from pushing through sharp bushes and scrub in dense forest on steep slopes.
She was unable to speak but told BBC Breakfast by text message she was overjoyed to have completed it.
David Miller, a professional photographer at the race, told BBC Scotland he had witnessed the <bb>"greatest ultramarathon achievement of all time.
There was a lot of anticipation at the finish line and three minutes before the 60 hour cut off we heard shouting and a roar,â€™ he said.

The Barkley is a grueling 20-mile race that changes every year.
Only 35 participants are allowed to take part each year.
The course was the brainchild of Gary Cantrell and Karl Henn.
The idea came when they heard about the escape of James Earl Ray.

Competitors must find between nine and 14 books along the course.
They must remove the page corresponding to their race number as proof of completion.
The first and third loops are run clockwise, while the second and fourth are run anticlockwise.
The race officially begins when the race director lights a cigarette.

Jasmin, who was born in Hadfield in Derbyshire, had previously completed what is called a <bb>"Fun Run.
She completed the Montane Spine Race in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds.
The first finisher of the fourth loop gets to decide which direction they go on the last loop.
She has since co-founded The Green Runners.

She has since been involved in a number of charitable causes, including charity work and charity work for the environment.
She is also a member of the board of directors of the charity The Greenrunners.

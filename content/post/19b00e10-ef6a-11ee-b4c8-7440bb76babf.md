# Driver who killed two children could walk streets

Rhiannon Lucas said she had been informed that Martin Newman was being moved to an open prison 25 miles from her home.
Newman killed Gracie-Ann, four, and Jayden Lee, three, in a crash on the M4.
He was jailed for nine years and four months.
Newman had been taking cocaine and drinking vodka and 10 cans of cider.

He was twice over the drink-driving limit and had traces of cocaine in his system.
His Ford Transit van ploughed into the family<bb>'s red Ford Fiesta after they had pulled over on the motorway.
She said Newman had never apologised for what he did.
She said: "The last few years have been so hard.

My dad is struggling, and the whole family is, really.
We just try and always talk about Gracie-Ann and Jayden Lee" She added: "Summer-Gracie will always know about her brother and sister" Joseph Wheaton, 27, said it was <bb>"a kick in the teeth.
He added that every day was hard and he and the family were suffering.
Rhiannon added she was told by the probation service that Newman would be able to stay at a family member<bb>'s house once a week.

# I ran 'toughest race' to inspire women worldwide

Jasmin Paris is one of only 20 people to have finished the Barkley Marathons since it was extended to 100 miles in 1989.
She crossed the finish line on Friday with 99 seconds to spare before the 60-hour cut-off.
The annual race involves five loops of roughly 20 miles (32km) with 60,000 ft (18,000m) of ascents and descents.
Jasmin slumped to the ground as she crossed the finish line.

Her arms and legs are covered in scratches from the brambles she had to push through.
But she said completing such a challenge was <bb>"mind-opening<bb>"" and inspires you with confidence.
The Barkley course was the brainchild of Gary and Karl Henn.
It was inspired by the famous escape of James Earl Ray.

Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr, eluded capture for more than 50 hours, but only travelled about 12 miles (19 km) Jasmin, who was born in Hadfield in Derbyshire, said the isolation of the race was one of the biggest challenges.
Now enjoying some much-deserved rest, she said: <bb>"I<bb>'m really looking forward to getting back to see the kids tomorrow.

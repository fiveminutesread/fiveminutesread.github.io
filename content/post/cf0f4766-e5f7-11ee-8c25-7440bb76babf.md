# Emma's killer 'should never have been out on bail'

Emma Baillie was strangled and repeatedly struck by John Duffy.
Duffy, 48, was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in prison last week.
He was also subject to three bail orders at the time of the attack.
Ms Baillies said she could not understand why he was allowed to be out on bail.

Social services raised concerns about Christopher McGowan weeks before he was deemed fit for bail and went on to murder his girlfriend.
Peter Duffy was found guilty of committing both murders between between 4 March and 12 April 2022.
Duffy killed Ms Baillie before she was due to appear in court as a witness against him on a charge of assault.

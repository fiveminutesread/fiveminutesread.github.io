Voting in Russia's presidential election begins on Friday.
Polls will close at 20:00 GMT on Sunday.
Putin is expected to win a fifth term as president.
He has been in power since 2000.

The election will take place in the eastern part of the country.
Vladimir Putin announces he will run for president of Russia.
The 71-year-old has been in power since 2000, apart from four years as prime minister because of a two-term limit.
He has already been president longer than any ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

Putin has changed the rules to give himself a clean slate to run again in 2024.
That means he could also run for another six-year term in 2030, when he will turn 78.
Putin has methodically tightened his grip on power so no real threat to his rule exists any longer.
Kremlin determined to give semblance of legitimacy to Russia<bb>#39;s electoral process.

Turnout at the last election in 2018 was officially 68%, but international observers reported several cases of ballot-stuffing.
This year, voting will be easier than ever before, ending on Sunday.
The other two candidates are Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist LDPR and Davankov of the New People.
Despite their vastly different political standings, all three broadly back the Kremlin<bb>#39;s policies.

None stands a chance against the leader of Russia.
Vladimir Putin has proposed a raft of social measures to tackle Russia's problems.
Many of his measures require considerable cash injections or investment.
Russia has a serious corruption problem that means funds often do not reach their intended destinations.

But that will hardly matter in an election that most international observers expect will be neither free nor fair.
In another video, nationalist leader Leonid Slutsky is shown trying out the office of his late predecessor Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The only potential intrigue so far has come from an initiative from Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
She has urged supporters to swamp polling stations at midday on Sunday and vote for anyone but Putin.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to be re-elected on 18 March.
The election campaign has been dominated by the state-controlled media.
The aim of the campaign is to allow supporters to identify one another.
The illusion of democracy is all but guaranteed to continue.

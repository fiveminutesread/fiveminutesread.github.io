# Ed Davey calls for 'once-in-generation' election

The party leader focused on the NHS in his speech in York on Sunday setting out reforms so people can see a GP, dentist or pharmacist.
No date has been set for the election.
It has to be held by January next year with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ruling out holding an election on 2 May.
The Liberal Democrats won 11 seats at the last general election in 2019.

The party has since gained four formerly Conservative constituencies in southern England.
Sir Ed called for a health service where community and primary healthcare services are the priority.
He said there needed to be investment in community services to save lives.
The Lib Dems are using the conference to prepare to push into areas traditionally held by Conservatives, including more seats in the south and south-west of England.

Sir Ed has refused to be drawn on discussions of a power-sharing pact, if there was a hung Parliament.
The spring conference comes to an end on Sunday.

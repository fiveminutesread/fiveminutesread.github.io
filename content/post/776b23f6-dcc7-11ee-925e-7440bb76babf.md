# Trump told to pay six-figure costs of firm he sued

Mrs Justice Steyn threw out the case against Orbis Business Intelligence.
She found that Mr Trump<bb>'s compensation claim was <bb>"bound to fail.
Mr Steele, who previously ran the Secret Intelligence Service<bb>#38;s Russia desk, was the author of the so-called Steele dossier.
The dossier, made up of more than a dozen memos, was produced by Orbis in 2016.

Mrs Justice Steyn said Orbis has estimated its costs to be more than £600,000.
She said £300,000 should be paid by Mr Trump before the total costs are decided by a specialist judge.
At the hearing in October 2023, Hugh Tomlinson KC, for Mr Trump, described the allegations in the memos as <bb>"egregiously inaccurate.
It was later leaked to and published by BuzzFeed in 2017.

Mr Trump is all but certain to win the Republican nomination and fight a likely election against incumbent President Joe Biden.

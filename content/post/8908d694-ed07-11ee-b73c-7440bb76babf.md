# Labour will level up better than Tories, Starmer says

Sir Keir Starmer launches Labour's local election campaign in Dudley.
Party confirms details of its plans to offer new powers to councils in England.
It would extend responsibilities given in recent years to mayors in city regions.
Also offer extra powers to areas that are yet to secure them.

There have been a series of devolution deals in recent years - with agreements with varying powers for local leaders agreed for 22 areas in England.
The government<bb>'s Levelling Up and Regeneration Act, which passed in October, set a target that every part of England should get a deal by 2030.

# M25 reopens eight hours ahead of schedule

The five-mile stretch of the M25 was due to be closed until 06:00 on Monday.
But it re-opened on Sunday, and some delays in both directions were reported.
National Highways project lead Jonathan Wade said congestion wasn't as dire as you might expect.
Carriageway closures happened along and between junctions 10 and 11.

The works are part of a Â£317m upgrade to the motorway.
The road was re-opened following the demolition of the Clearmount bridge.
National Highways said this was the first of five closures between now and September.
M25 closed between junctions 9 and 11 between 10:00 and 21:00 on a weekend.

It is the first planned daytime closure of the motorway since it opened in 1986.
An 11.
5-mile diversion route was created to direct traffic along A roads.
Four more daytime closures of the M25 will take place up to September.

The project, due to be completed in summer 2025, will increase the number of lanes at junction 10.
It is one of the UK<bb>#39;s busiest and most dangerous motorway junctions.

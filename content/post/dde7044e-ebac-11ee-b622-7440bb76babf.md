# King will attend Easter church service at Windsor

The King and Queen will attend the Easter Sunday service at St George<bb>'s Chapel at Windsor Castle.
It will be one of the most significant events King Charles will have attended since his cancer diagnosis last month.
But the Prince and Princess of Wales will not be there, as Catherine continues with her cancer treatment.
The King will be with Queen Camilla, who has been carrying a number of solo royal engagements in her husband<bb>'s absence.

He has not been at public events this year, after having treatment for an enlarged prostate and later revealing that he had been diagnosed with a form of cancer.
The Easter church service is a regular feature of the royal calendar.
It is usually attended by many senior royals, but this year it is expected to be a smaller gathering.
Her husband Prince William and their three children will also not be at St George<bb>'s Chapel on Sunday.

# Mother charged with murder of 10-year-old girl

Shay Kang was discovered fatally injured at the house in Rowley Regis.
Jaskirat Kaur, also known as Jasmine Kang, has been charged with murder.
The 33-year-old appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Shay attended nearby Brickhouse Primary School where staff described her as bright and fun-loving.

Ms Kaur spoke only to confirm her name and date of birth and was remanded into custody to next appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday.
She was not required to indicate any plea to the murder charge.
Her tragic death has had a profound impact on those who knew her as well as the wider community," he said.
We ask that they are left to grieve in private as our enquiries continue.

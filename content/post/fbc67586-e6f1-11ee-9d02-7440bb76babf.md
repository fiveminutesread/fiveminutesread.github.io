# Man murdered couple with fentanyl after re-writing will

Stephen Baxter, 61, and his wife Carol, 64, were found dead at their home in West Mersea, Essex, in April 2023.Luke D;Wit, 34, had rewritten the coupleâ€™s will so he could seize control of their business after their deaths, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.He will be sentenced later.A bag containing both opened and unopened fentanyl patches was found.

Metal tacks, which police believe were the same ones found during a scan of Mrs Baxter;s stomach when she was alive, were also discovered in the bag.  Toxicology reports later showed fentanyl was a factor in both deaths.  Luke D;Wit.

My mum lost her freedom, her will, her ability to function two years prior to her murder due to her illness.An illness no-one could help with or understand because it was contrived by Luke.

Luke DWit took what we all held most sacred and found a way to extract it for himself.Mum felt so alone and lost and there was nothing I could do other then give her my shoulder to cry on and cuddle her.

The character of Bianca Jackson, played by Patsy Palmer, returned to screens in scenes set in her home in Milton Keynes.
MP Ben Everitt, the MP for Milton Keynes North, said he was unhappy with the portrayal.
He said he would be contacting producers of the programme to suggest another storyline.
The scenes for the episode were filmed in Barnet, London, and saw characters Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) and her partner Zack Hudson (James Farrar) visit Bianca who has not been seen on the programme since 2019.

A caller to the JVS show on BBC Three Counties Radio said he had to switch off BBC1 when he watched the programme.
Mr Everitt said the depiction was not a major political issue.
He said it was important to him that the city be represented fairly.
Milton Keynes is one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the UK.

The city is home to more than 100,000 people.

# Harris set to become new Fine Gael leader later

Nominations closed at 13:00 local time on Sunday.
Mr Harris was the only candidate for the position at the close of nominations.
He is set to replace Leo Varadkar, who announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as party leader and taoiseach.
The 37-year-old was the early favourite, with many backing him before nominations even opened.

Ministers Helen McEntee, Paschal Donohoe and Heather Humphreys were among those to throw their support behind Mr Harris.
Mr Varadkar caused shock when he announced he would be stepping down as Fine Gael leader immediately.
Senator Currie also said the new party leader is very much interested in all-island issues.
This includes giving Northern Irish students more opportunities to study in the Republic of Ireland.

34;He is a very compassionate person and I think the empathy that he has, and understanding of victims of the north, I am very encouraged by.

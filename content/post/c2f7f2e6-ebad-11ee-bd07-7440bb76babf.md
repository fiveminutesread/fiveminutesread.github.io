# UK approach to China is 'robust', Sunak says

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the government<bb>'s approach to China.
Comes after some MPs criticised the response to cyber-attacks against the Electoral Commission and UK politicians.
The government has blamed the attacks on Beijing-linked hackers.
Downing Street has played down suggestions the government is preparing to do this.

Prime Minister says EU countries have gone further in protecting themselves.
He says China represents the greatest state-based threat to our economic security.
Some MPs want the government to formally label the country a threat.
Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has suggested this could happen.

He said: <bb>"I am entirely confident that our approach to dealing with the risk that China poses is very much in line with our allies.
The PM's official spokesman said there was no mechanism under UK law to designate China a threat.
He said the integrated review has already set out the UK<bb>'s position in relation to China being a state-based threat to our economic security.
He told the Commons that the country's alleged involvement in the cyber-attacks will have a very strong bearing on the decision we make.

No countries have been specified yet in the foreign influence registration scheme.
It gives the power to require registration of activities of foreign government-controlled entities in the UK.
The government announced sanctions on two Chinese nationals, as well as the China state-affiliated cyber espionage group Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31.
The sanctions were part of coordinated action alongside the UK<bb>'s allies, with the United States  charging seven alleged Chinese hackers on Monday.

Some of the MPs targeted have criticised the government's response, with Sir Iain describing it as like an elephant giving birth to a mouse.
China has rejected allegations of state involvement in the hacks.

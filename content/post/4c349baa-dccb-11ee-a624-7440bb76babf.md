Horner, whose wife Geri was in the Spice Girls, added: <bb>"I am fortunate I have a beautiful family and a very supportive wife.
Horner: "It has been very trying, and very challenging.
My wife has been hugely supportive, as has my family" He added: "We need to move forward and focus on what we are here for.

It is time now to focus on Formula 1 racing" Last week, Jos Verstappen, father of Max, said the controversy over Horner was driving people apart.
Horner said: <bb>"I spoke to Jos following the grand prix and it<bb>'s in everybodyâ€™s interests collectively that we have agreed to move on and focus on the future.

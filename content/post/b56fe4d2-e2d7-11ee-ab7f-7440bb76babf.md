Charities in England, Scotland and Wales told Newsbeat they struggled to keep up with demand in 2023.
They urged the UK government to confirm it will extend its scheme providing free period products in English schools and colleges past July 2024.
Department for Education spokesperson said 99% of England<bb>#39;s secondaries have used the service since 2020.
Jess now volunteers with The SuPer Project, in Nottingham, to make reusable menstrual products.

The average cost of disposable products in the UK is around Â£10 a month per person, according to charity Bloody Good Period.
Jess: "People need all the money they can get at the moment to put on their gas" Jess says reusables have the potential to break people out of period poverty.
But she admits there<bb>#39;s a stigma around reusable products.
She puts that down to things like the use of words such as <bb>#34;sanitary<bb>#34.

The availability of free period products varies according to where you live.
Welsh government wants to achieve period dignity by 2027.
Scottish government made period products free to school, college and university students in 2018.
In England, the Period Products Scheme has been in place since 2020.

And the government says its funding will continue until at least July 2024.
Education on how to use tampons and pads is also something that is lacking, in her view.
She feels that the schemes available are good, but politicians and other authority figures don<bb>#39;t do enough to publicise the availability of free product schemes.
Many young people are coming forward and telling us their stories of the first time they had to used tampons without any education too.

Sali Hughes runs Beauty Banks, an organisation that gives out essential hygiene products to charities to distribute to those in need.
She says being unable to access period products can have a huge impact on girls' education.
We have to ensure that girls do learn how to safely use period products" Sali believes period provision should be seen as a basic healthcare measure.
She believes it should be made available free to those who need it.

39;No pads at school, so my period leaked on exam chair<bb>#39;" she says.
Please can we continue to have period products which are absolutely essential items to students in schools?

# Half-sister's defamation case against Meghan Markle dismissed

Samantha Markle was suing Meghan over comments she made in a Netflix documentary and an interview with Oprah Winfrey.
Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell found these comments were either opinions, substantially true, or did not plausibly defame Samantha.
The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning she will not be able to refile.
The lawsuit also took issue with Meghan<bb>#39;s remarks on how close they were growing up.

Meghan told Winfrey: <bb>#34;I grew up as an only child, which everyone who grew up around me knows, and I wished I had siblings.
She first took legal action in March 2022, alleging the duchess had defamed her by giving information to an unauthorised biography.
Case was thrown out last year after Judge Honeywell found she could not be liable for the contents of the book because she had not published it.

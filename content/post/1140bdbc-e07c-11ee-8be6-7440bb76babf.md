# Karl Wallinger, songwriter and Waterboys member, dies aged 66

The Welsh-born musician played on hits including The Whole of the Moon.
Wallinger also fronted solo project World Party.
No cause of death has yet been announced by the band or his family.
He was one of the best musicians I've ever known, says Waterboys frontman.

Karl Wallinger left the Waterboys in 1985 and, from 1986 to 2000, released music under the name World Party.
During his time with the group, they scored a major hit with The Whole of the Moon.
Wallinger suffered a brain aneurysm in 2001 and spent five years away from the spotlight.

# Why Macron went from dove to hawk on Russia

What came over Emmanuel Macron to turn him from appeaser to warmonger in the matter of Russia and Ukraine?
That is the question being asked in chancelleries across Europe, as the French president warms to his new role as the continent<bb>#39;s resister-in-chief to Vladimir Putin.
How genuine is the new Macron line?
Is his refusal to rule out sending troops to Ukraine just another of his surprises - testimony to his insatiable need to cut a diplomatic dash?

And how much of his new positioning is purely politics?
European elections are approaching, and the hard-right of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella looks set to trounce the Macronites.
Not remotely embarrassed about his new-found alarmism, he explained it.
Only after all efforts to reach out to an adversary have been exhausted, he argued, is it possible to say conclusively that that adversary is beyond the pale.

The president<bb>#39;s view was that the one inevitably had to precede the other.
The Kremlin has stepped up its attacks on France and other countries.
France and Europe need to be ready for war, says the French president.
But can he convince the world of the need for a new era of peace?

It's a big ask for a leader with so little experience.
The most glaring sign is the rift that separates the French leader from the man who is supposed to be his closest ally in Europe, Germany<bb>#39;s Olaf Scholz.
Both sides are now publicly patching up and putting on the mandatory common front.
But no amount of man-hugs can conceal the fundamental discord.

If there is an electoral subtext to his new hard line on Moscow, then it does not seem to be working.
Opinion surveys show support for Le Pen's National Rally (RN) only strengthening.
More generally, while most people are clearly opposed to Russia, the Ifop polling company reports a progressive erosion of support for the Ukrainian cause.

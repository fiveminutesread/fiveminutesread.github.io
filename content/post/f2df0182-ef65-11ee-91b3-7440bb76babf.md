# Lizzo says she 'quits' after 'lies' against her

Lizzo said she is fed up of being targeted for her looks and character online.
She did not clarify if this meant she was leaving the music industry or social media.
Her post comes a day after a lawyer representing her former dancers criticised the decision to choose the pop star to headline a fundraising event.
The Good as Hell singer, 35, said she was constantly up against lies.

She added she felt she was the butt of the joke every single time.
Lizzo said her character was being picked apart by people who don<bb>'t know her.
Stars were quick to show their support for the singer.
Lizzo is known for celebrating her body and self-love.

She has spoken out in the past about hurtful online comments about her looks.
Last August, three of her former dancers sued Lizzo over claims including sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment.
The legal action includes accusations of sexual, religious and racial harassment, discrimination, assault and false imprisonment.

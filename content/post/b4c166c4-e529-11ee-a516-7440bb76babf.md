# Banksy confirms London tree mural is his own work

The tree mural appeared on Hornsey Road, in Finsbury Park, on Sunday morning.
It shows green paint sprayed on a wall behind a cut-back tree to look like foliage, with a stencil of a person holding a pressure hose next to it.
The elusive artist usually confirms his work on his website and social media, and on Monday he posted images of the artwork with no caption.
Banksy is one of the world;s most famous artists, but his identity remains officially unknown.

His most recent known piece, a stop sign with three military drones on it, was stolen in broad daylight just hours after it had been confirmed as authentic in December last year.

# Fresh Lords battle looms over Rwanda bill changes

The government<bb>#39;s Rwanda deportation bill could face a further delay.
MPs voted down 10 amendments to the draft law proposed by the House of Lords earlier this month.
Labour peers will try and reinsert five or six of the proposed changes when the bill returns to the Lords on Wednesday.
The proposed law aims to ensure the UK can deport asylum seekers to Rwanda by declaring it to be a safe place.

The Supreme Court ruled last year it could lead to human rights breaches.
The bill will now return to the Lords on Wednesday in a process known as <bb>#34;ping pong.
If they fail, the bill could become law by the end of this week.
However, the party will order them to try again to reinsert amendments.

The amendments are designed to prevent flights taking off until the UK has more assurances that Rwanda is a safe country.
The bill is expected to be voted on by MPs on Thursday.
Michael Tomlinson, Home Office minister, told the Commons on Monday that the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill was an essential element of protecting the UK's borders.
Another vote would probably have to wait until MPs return from their Easter break on April 15, potentially delaying any flights by several weeks.

I would expect the government to be very sensible and sensitive to the position of Afghan refugees and future refugees and not put them into this scheme, he said.
It does seem to me to lose nothing by adding this particular insertion.

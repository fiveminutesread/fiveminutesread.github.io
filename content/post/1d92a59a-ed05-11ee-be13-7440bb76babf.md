# King tells of 'great sadness' at missing Maundy service

The King is not attending public events while he has treatment for cancer.
He recorded a message that was played at the service at Worcester Cathedral.
King Charles has spoken of his <bb>"great sadness<bb>"" at missing the traditional Maundy Thursday service.
Queen Camilla was instead at the service, where she handed out Maundy money.

The number of recipients matches the age of the monarch - so 75 men and women will receive this symbolic gift.
The King's message included a Bible reading and a call that as a nation we need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us.
The King had sent a video message to the annual Commonwealth service earlier this month.
Worcester Cathedral did not have the video facilities, so an audio message was played instead.

The anti-monarchy group Republic issued a statement ahead of the service saying the monarchy is <bb>"bad for Britain<bb>'s democracy.

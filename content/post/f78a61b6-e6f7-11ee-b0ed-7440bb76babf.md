# Two arrested in Russia's first LGBTQ+ extremism case

Two employees of an LGBTQ+ club in the Russian city of Orenburg arrested.
Art director of the club, Alexander Klimov, and administrator Diana Kamilyanova will remain in custody until 18 May.
It is the first criminal case of its kind since Russia<bb>#39;s Supreme Court outlawed the so-called international LGBT movement last November.
Police raid gay club in Orenburg, Russia.

Items confiscated included a female stage costume, five female wigs, and fake female breasts.
Case could set a precedent for how the law is applied to LGBTQ+ people in Russia.
Police began raiding gay clubs across Russia soon after the Supreme Court decision last year.
Last month a woman in Nizhny Novgorod was arrested for wearing a rainbow flag.

The rainbow flag is now considered a symbol of the LGBT community in Russia.
In 2013, a law was adopted prohibiting non-traditional sexual relations among minors.
The law was passed in response to a petition signed by 1,000 people.

# Outpouring of support for Kate after cancer news

Princess of Wales reveals she is being treated for cancer.
She has been receiving chemotherapy since late February.
Cancer charities have praised her openness, while world leaders, friends and celebrities have wished her well.
The news has also led to calls for her and her family to be given privacy.

Catherine said she and Prince William had taken time to sensitively share the state of her health with their children.
King Charles III said he was <bb>#34;so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did.
The Princess of Wales said she was feeling well and getting stronger every day.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to have reached out privately to the Prince and Princess of Wales.

King Charles and Queen Camilla had already been informed about the princess<bb>#39;s health.
Others have also called for her to be given space and privacy to recover.
He said he had been diagnosed with cancer two years ago and that telling his three adult children had been one of the toughest things he had ever done.
Rod Laight, chairman of trustees of the Primrose Hospice in Bromsgrove said many families would find comfort from Catherine and her words.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday that Catherine had shown ‘tremendous bravery’ in the face of intense scrutiny.
Ms Watts’s mother Valerie, who was visiting the historic town from Southport, said she hoped Catherine<bb>#39;s video would end all the speculation.
Catherine and the Prince of Wales are not expected to appear with the Royal Family on Easter Sunday.
There will not be any early return to official duties for the princess either.

While Catherine has stood back from royal duties, Charles has continued with his constitutional role as head of state.

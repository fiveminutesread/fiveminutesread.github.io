# Rahm criticises world rankings as LIV ends interest

Masters champion Jon Rahm said the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) is not a good system.
LIV Golf withdrew its application to join the OWGR in October.
CEO Greg Norman told players it will not pursue its bid for world ranking points.
Two-time major winner and world number three Rahm is among the players to have switched from the PGA Tour.

LIV Golf Hong Kong begins on Friday.
The OWGR raised concerns about the new league's format.
It features the same 54 players all season who play 54-hole, shotgun start, no-cut events.
Rahm: "The more time goes on, the more it proves to be wrong" LIV players will only be able to improve their world ranking through DP World Tour events, the Asian Tour or other satellite tours.

Many of the big names that left the US PGA Tour have slipped down the rankings.
Rahm is one of just four LIV players who currently feature in the OWGR<bb>'s top 50.
The majors can make exceptions and issue their own invitations.
The US Masters and US PGA Championship will be played in May.

The Masters is the first major of the year to be played on the PGA Tour.
The PGA is the second major after the US Open in April.
Former major winners Rahm, Cameron Smith, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson already have places for this year<bb>'s British Open.
British Open officials have made no concessions to LIV Golf, making it increasingly difficult to qualify for the tournament.

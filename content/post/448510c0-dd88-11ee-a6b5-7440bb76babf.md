# TV star shaken after Jaguar brakes fail during drive

It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion.
Earlier this week another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said a full review is underway to determine the cause of this incident.
Mr Phillips' experience happened on New Year<bb>'s Eve 2023.

He had owned the car for more than three years and has now returned it.
The safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR<bb>#38;s highest priority, the company said.
Jaguar I-Pace offers regenerative braking, in which the energy created as the car brakes is re-captured and sent back to the battery.
Thousands of the cars have been sold in the UK since 2018, which cost nearly Â£70,000.

In 2019, some Jaguar I-pace vehicles were recalled in North America because of a fault with the system.

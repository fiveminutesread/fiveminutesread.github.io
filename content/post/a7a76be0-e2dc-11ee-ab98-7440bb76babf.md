# NI 'back in business' Murphy tells US investors

Political stability means Northern Ireland is <bb>#34;back in business, Conor Murphy has been telling potential American investors.
Murphy: "We are a nation of entrepreneurs.
We are a country of innovators.
We have a long way to go, but we are on the right track" The economy minister is currently in the US ahead of St Patrick<bb>#39;s Day celebrations.

He said he has been highlighting the certainty around post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had wanted changes to the way Northern Ireland trades with Great Britain to ease its concerns.
DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the reception had been 'very positive' He said there were real opportunities to be gleaned from promoting the political stability at Stormont.
But he said that investment would take time and was not taken on a whim.

He said: <bb>#34;I am not sure I was public enemy number one.
The first and deputy first ministers will be at the Speaker<bb>#39;s lunch today on Capitol Hill.
The visit has gone down well judging by the response they received at the gala dinner.
There is a great sense that at last we have political stability in Northern Ireland, the sense that they might be able to cash in on the dual market access.

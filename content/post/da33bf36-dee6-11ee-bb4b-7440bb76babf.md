# Gaza war fuels Jerusalem fears as Ramadan to begin

Hamas has reiterated a call for Palestinians to step up visits to al-Aqsa Mosque.
The third holiest shrine in Islam is a place of worship for local Muslims.
It is also the holiest place in Judaism, known as Temple Mount.
Ramadan is due to begin on 10 or 11 March depending on sighting of the new moon.

Israel says its spy chief met with his US counterpart as it continued efforts to try to release dozens of hostages.
A framework plan being discussed would see some of the Israeli hostages snatched by Hamas in its deadly 7 October attacks released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in aid.
UN warnings of famine.
Abu Nader had been following the news, as he crossed al-Aqsa in his mobility scooter.

How will we break our daily fast and eat when we think of our compatriots in Gaza,<bb>" commented Abu Nader, who had been watching the news.
Israel captured East Jerusalem, including this part of the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
The site has become a prominent symbol of the wider Palestinian struggle.
Israeli police are always visibly dotted around the vast al-Aqsa mosque complex and have officers present at every gate, controlling access.

Last year, when Ramadan overlapped with the Jewish Passover holiday, reports circulated that Jewish extremists planned to carry out the ritual sacrifice of a goat on Temple Mount.
Hamas then fired rockets at Jerusalem, leading to a short war in Gaza and widespread unrest between Jewish and Arab Israelis.
This year, Ramadan does not coincide with any major Jewish holiday.
Worshippers will be permitted to enter the mosque during the first week of Ramadan.

It is not yet clear what numbers will be allowed to reach the site.
During the Gaza war, Israel has largely blocked Palestinians from the West Bank from entering Jerusalem.
Typically, tens of thousands would pass through Israeli military checkpoints to attend Friday prayers.
A few years ago, Israel allowed practically everyone who wanted to, to come from the West Bank and there wasn<bb>'t one single incident, says Imam Mustafa Abu Sway.

If the Israeli police and security forces leave them alone, everything will, hopefully, be ok.

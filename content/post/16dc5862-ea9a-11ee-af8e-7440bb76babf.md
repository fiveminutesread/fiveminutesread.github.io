# Olivia Colman: I'd be paid more if I was Oliver

Olivia Colman says she would be paid a lot more if she was a man.
Says she knows of one pay disparity which was a 12,000% difference.
The issue of equal pay in Hollywood burst into the open a decade ago.
The latest top 10 list of the best-paid actors contains just two women.

Colman joined the Hollywood A-list in 2019 when she won the best actress Oscar for playing Queen Anne in The Favourite.
Her TV credits include Heartstopper and Secret Invasion, and she played Queen Elizabeth II in series three and four of Netflix<bb>'s The Crown.
Equal pay in Hollywood was put into the spotlight after a hack in 2014 of emails from Sony executives.
Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams were paid less than their male co-stars for American Hustle.

The treatment of women in Hollywood continued to be in the spotlight as the #MeToo movement took off.

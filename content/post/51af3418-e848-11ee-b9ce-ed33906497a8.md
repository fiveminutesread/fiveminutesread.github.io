# Skier in coma after ravine fall in Bulgaria

Olivia Corbiere, from Aston near Sheffield, suffered serious injuries, including a brain bleed and lung damage, in the accident on Sunday.  She had to be placed in an induced coma and needed brain surgery.  Her injuries included severe head trauma, a broken eye socket and a broken pelvis.

To date, more than Â£23,000 has been raised.  Mrs Corbiere said she did not know what her long-term prognosis will be.  The fundraiser will help immensely, she said.  To donate, visit www.justgiving.com/michael-corbiere-fundraiser.

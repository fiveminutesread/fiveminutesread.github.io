Tomás Mac an t-Saoir has cycled across the world.
He started in Ireland but has now gone to Asia, Africa and Pakistan.
He says he wants to meet as many people as he can along the way.
He also works as a freelance writer and photographer.

Many of the places he visits are affordable to eat in, especially if you stay away from the main tourist places.
He has met other cyclists who are living off as little as $5 (£4) a day.
Tomás said there is no way to make cycling thousands of miles easy.
Tomás has cycled around the world and has experienced kindness wherever he has gone.

He has been in the US, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South East Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East.
Tomás: "People see you on the bike and they want to know if you need money, water, food or a place to sleep" Sudanese people go above and beyond to look after their guests, he says.
It<bb>'s also ingrained in their religion that you look after guests," he adds.
If I tried to camp, it was like I insulted the whole country by having the audacity" Afghanistan, though has been a highlight to date.

Despite the humanitarian and economic crisis people were still kind, he said.
He said his family is used to it by now, but he added that his parents will always worry.
He was biking with two Canadian guys in Africa.
They treated him as one of their own.

Tomás says his biggest takeaway has been the goodness in people.
He said: "I wont be doing this forever, so I am making the most of it while I can" He added that lots of the people he had met had come and stayed at his home in Ireland.

# Send 'arrogant' Starmer a message, Sunak tells voters

PM claims Labour leader has no plan for how to run the country.  Mr Sunak said voters should look to councils like Birmingham to see what Labour would do if they win power.  Many Conservatives are braced for a bad night on 2 May when council elections are being held across England and Wales.  Hundreds of job losses, services slashed, streetlights being dimmed or switched off, making the streets less safe.

They;re not even going to collect the rubbish as much as they used to - and they<bb>#39;re going to charge you, when the rats come, to take the rats away.  Voters will go to the polls on 2 May to elect more than 100 councillors.  Labour has not yet announced details of their election campaign.  The Lib Dems have already launched their campaign in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.

The Tories have not yet revealed their campaign plans for the election.

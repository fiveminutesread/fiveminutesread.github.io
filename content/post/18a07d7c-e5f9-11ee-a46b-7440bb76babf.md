# Raducanu's lower back injury 'nothing serious'

The 21-year-old was due to face China<bb>#39;s Wang Xiyu in the first round on Tuesday.
Raducanu was beaten in straight sets by world number two Aryna Sabalenka in the third round at Indian Wells last week.
It is not known whether the injury will impact her selection for Great Britain's King Cup squad.
Raducanu had recorded back-to-back victories for the first time since winning three in a row at Indian Wells 12 months ago.

She made her return to the tour in January following an eight-month absence.
Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie, Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Katie Boulter are preparing to start their tournaments in Miami.
British number ones Norrie and Boulter play on Friday, as the pair have both received a first-round bye as one of the 32 men<bb>#39;s and women<bb>#38;s seeded players.
The pair will be joined in the second round by Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka.

# Six inmates die at prison within three weeks

Security firm G4S, which runs HMP Parc in Bridgend, said the deaths occurred between 27 February and 19 March.
Two of the men have been named as John Rose and Jason Hussey, both of whom died on the same day.
The others are expected to be named later this week.
Mr Usher said he is keeping an open mind as to whether or not there is a causal link behind these deaths.

HMP Parc said: <bb>#34;Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the prisoners who have died recently at Parc.
The Prison and Probation Ombudsman will investigate.
HMP Parc is a category B local prison holding convicted male adult and young offenders and convicted and remand sex offenders.
At the time of a 2019 inspection it held 1,612 prisoners, making it one of the largest prisons in the UK.

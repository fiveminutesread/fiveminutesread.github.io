# 'My best friend saved me by giving me his kidney'

Steven Smith had been experiencing cramps and occasional vomiting.
A routine blood test revealed his kidney function was down to 20%.
He was told if it got any lower he would need a transplant.
Steven told his best friend, Kael Ace, who was a perfect match.

Steven's mother gave him her kidney after he was diagnosed with kidney failure.
The friends used pictures to verify their 10-year friendship, which started when they joined the same rugby team.
They then interviewed each other separately to make sure nothing untoward was going on, Steven said.
Steven was best man at Kael<bb>'s wedding last October.

By September 2023 his kidney function had dropped to 2% and he was having dialysis three times a week.
Kael said it was difficult seeing his friend deteriorate.
The operation on 19 February was a success and the best friends are both doing well.
Steven has urged people to go to the GP if they sense anything is wrong.

He said: "I hadn<bb>'t felt like that in about three years.

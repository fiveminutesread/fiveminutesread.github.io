# Boy admits killing schoolgirl at London bus stop

Elianne Andam, 15, was attacked on Wellesley Road, Croydon, in September.
The teenage boy, who cannot be named because of his age, pleaded guilty to her manslaughter but denied murder.
A trial is set to take place in November at the Old Bailey.
Elianne had met two female friends before she was fatally stabbed.

It is alleged by the prosecution that her attacker, wearing a mask and gloves, removed a large knife from his waistband and stabbed Elianne repeatedly.
The defendant was arrested in New Addington later that morning.
Elianne had a love for music, friends, fashion, gymnastics, drawing, cooking and singing.
She had acharismatic and vivacious personality, her mother said.

We take comfort in the knowledge that she is at peace, with her faith realised," she said.

# Beyoncé album is missing tracks on vinyl, fans say

Cowboy Carter was released to critical acclaim on Friday.
But some of the best-received songs are reportedly not present on the vinyl edition.
Spaghetti, Flamenco, The Linda Martell Show, Ya Ya and Oh Louisiana are reported missing.
The BBC has contacted Beyoncé<bb>'s representatives for comment.

Fans have also reported that CD copies are missing four tracks.
The likely explanation is that Beyoncé added these songs late into the album<bb>'s creation.
Beyoncé's new album is due out on July 26.

Beyoncé also modified her previous album, Renaissance, in the week after its release.
She changed a lyric to remove a slur commonly used to demean people with cerebral palsy.
In a press release issued on Friday, the star said Cowboy Carter had taken over five years to create.

The suggestion that Cowboy Carter had been waiting in the wings for several years caused confusion, with fans demanding to know why their physical copies were incomplete.

We deserved to dance, but I had to trust God<bb>'s timing.
Beyonce's new album is titled <bb>"Act ii: Beyincé.

Fans have speculated that the star changed her album<bb>'s title late in the day.
The spine of the CD and vinyl copies is labelled <bb>#32;Act II:Beyincé' This is a reference to the star's ancestral surname.
The album deals with the marginalisation of black people in country music and the American South.
It skilfully blends the sounds of country and American folk with hip-hop, pop and glistening funk.

Beyoncé added that the album<bb>'s organic sound was partially in response to the digital production techniques behind most modern pop albums - including her own.
All the sounds were so organic and human, everyday things like the wind, snaps and even the sound of birds and chickens, the sounds of nature.

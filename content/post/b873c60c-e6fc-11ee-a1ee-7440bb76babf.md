# FIA clears president over race interference claims

Mohammed Ben Sulayem was alleged to have intervened to overturn a penalty for Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
A whistleblower claimed the president told officials not to certify the Las Vegas circuit for last year;s race.
The FIA said there was no evidence to support the claims.  The president showed complete co-operation, transparency, and compliance throughout the process during this investigation, the government said.

Ben Sulayem was cleared of any wrongdoing by the investigation.  The investigation was carried out by the National Crime Agency and the Serious Organized Crime Agency.

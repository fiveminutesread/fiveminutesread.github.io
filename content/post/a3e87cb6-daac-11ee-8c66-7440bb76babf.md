# France makes abortion a constitutional right

France has become the first country in the world to explicitly include the right to abortion in its constitution.
The overwhelming 780-72 vote saw a standing ovation in the parliament in Versailles when the result was announced.
President Emmanuel Macron described the move as <bb>"French pride<bb>#34.
Around 85% of the public supported amending the constitution to protect the right to end a pregnancy.

It becomes the 25th amendment to modern France<bb>'s founding document, and the first since 2008.
Anti-abortion groups have strongly criticised the change, as has the Vatican.
The move to enshrine abortion in the French constitution has been welcomed by many.
But not all support it, with the Vatican repeating its opposition to abortion.

Individual states are now able to ban the procedure again, ending the right to an abortion for millions of women.

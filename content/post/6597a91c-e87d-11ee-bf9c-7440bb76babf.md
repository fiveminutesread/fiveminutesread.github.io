# Malaysia rejects offer to host Commonwealth Games

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) offered Malaysia Â£100m as supporting funds after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew as host.  But Malaysia;s sports ministry said the offer ;will not cover the overall cost of hosting a large-scale sports event.
The economic impact could not be identified in this short timeframe, it added.  The confidential process to determine a host is continuing with other interested Commonwealth Games Associations, said a CGF spokesperson.

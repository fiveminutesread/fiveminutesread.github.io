# Lollipop man, 93, made redundant from crossing job

Alfred Tollon has been helping pupils cross the road at Harrow Lodge Primary School for 24 years.
He said his job had kept him motivated after his wife died.
Mr Tollon even offered to work for free but Havering Council told him the cost of insuring him was prohibitive.
Fewer than 15% of schools in Havering now have crossing patrol officers.

Some parents at the school said they were worried about safety.
On his last day of work the school made Mr Tollon the guest of honour at their Easter Parade, and presented him with handmade cards.
Less than 15% of schools have crossing patrol officers.
Havering Council say they are facing 'unprecedented financial challenges' A number of staff redundancies have been made as a result of the review, they say.

The council has installed extra crossings instead of crossing patrols.

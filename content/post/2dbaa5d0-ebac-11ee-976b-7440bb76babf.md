# How do you save the pint from climate change?

Hops give bitter its taste but the plant doesn<bb>'t like the hotter, drier conditions.
Researchers in Kent are isolating hop genes in the hope of producing more climate-change resilient varieties.
They also want to produce more intense flavours that are now becoming popular.
Eddie Gadd, the head brewer at Ramsgate Brewery said that it was already having an impact.

An analysis published last year found that in some key hop-growing areas, there was a drop of nearly 20% in output.
The new research is co-led by Dr Helen Cockerton of the University of Kent.
Dr Cockerton is working with Dr Klara Hajdu, a hop breeder with Wye Hops.
She will also be searching for genes that give beer added flavours.

Some of these may not be popular now, but could become fashionable in a few years' time.
Dr Hajdu will breed the new varieties with the new drought, disease and flavour genes.
She will then ask Eddie Gadd to produce beer from the experimental varieties.
The project is part of a larger research initiative funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) The Farming Minister, Mark Spencer said he was delighted to see projects like the beer study roll out.

He said he will continue to provide opportunities, funding and support to empower [brewers] to put innovation at the heart of modern agricultural practices.

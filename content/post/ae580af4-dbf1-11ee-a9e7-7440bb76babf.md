# Cameron meets Israel minister after Gaza aid warning

Lord Cameron told Mr Gantz, a retired general and member of Israel<bb>'s war cabinet, that <bb>"we are still not seeing improvements on the ground.
The two met in central London on Wednesday afternoon.
The foreign secretary stressed that Israel had a legal responsibility to ensure the availability of aid.
Lord Cameron said the UK was pushing for more aid to get into Gaza.

The amount that had reached the territory in February was just half that of the previous month.
International law states that an occupying power has a duty to ensure food and medical supplies to the population under its control.
The moderate chairman of Israel<bb>'s National Unity Party has proved a stiff political opponent to Netanyahu.
He joined him as a member of his war cabinet after the attack nearly five months ago by Hamas that triggered the conflict.

More than 30,700 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war.

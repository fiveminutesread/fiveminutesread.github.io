# Seven of the best moments from the Oscars

Ryan Gosling sang I<bb>'m Just Ken at the Oscars.
The full-throated rendition of the hit was even better than we could have hoped for.
Slash appeared to lend his talents for a guitar solo.
The Oscars brought more than three hours of glamour and nudity.

The Kenergy was infectious - Gosling solicited energetic singalongs from the star-studded front row.
There were even suggestions the choreography was a homage to Diamonds Are A Girl<bb>'s Best Friend.
Best actress winner Emma Stone even had a wardrobe malfunction due to all the excitement.
Kimmel also got into a spat with Donald Trump that went viral.

Kimmel nodded to the months-long strikes that brought Hollywood (nearly) to a halt.
A jab at Robert Downey Jr and his history of substance abuse drew some blank stares from the crowd.
Stars including Billie Eilish, Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef sporting red pins in support of a ceasefire (Artists4Ceasefire) between Israel and Hamas.
Los Angeles police stood by in riot gear to the sound of honking horns.

The pins were from Artists4Ceasefire, a group of stars and others who signed an open letter urging President Biden to call for a ceasefire.
The war was noted from the Oscars stage itself, as the British director Jonathan Glazer accepted the best international film statue for his film The Zone of Interest.
Glazer said he rejected his Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people.
Da<bb>'Vine Joy Randolph was moved to tears by a heart-felt introduction from Lupita Nyong.

Randolph had us crying ourselves moments later when she accepted the trophy for best supporting actress.
John Cena appeared on stage entirely naked, save for a pair of Birkenstocks and a strategically placed envelope carrying the name of the winner.
Backstage, she spoke about encouraging creatives from under-represented backgrounds to keep going.
The beautiful thing that erupts is your imagination and creativity because you don<bb>'t have muchâ€¦.

Something I think as black people, we are very good at, is making a lot out of very little.
It<bb>#38;s our superpower.
40; The best picture-nominated Anatomy of a Fall boasted a four-legged break-out star: Messi, the black-and-white border collie who plays Snoop the dog in the French courtroom drama.
Messi appeared at the ceremony, sitting in a plush red seat with a black bow-tie around his neck.

Murphy wins best actor as Oppenheimer sweeps awards.
Gosling also looked delighted to see Messi again, having previously made his acquaintance at the Oscars Luncheon last month.

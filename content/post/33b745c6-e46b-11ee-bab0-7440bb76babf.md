# Iceland state of emergency after volcanic flare-up

Lava has reached the eastern defences around the small, evacuated town of Grindavik.
Activity around the fissure - initially 3km long (1.
9 miles) - has dissipated.
It is the fourth eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula since December.

The eruption began after 20:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday.
This is a similar location to the eruption that began on 8 December.
Two lava streams have been moving west and south.
Local media reported that lava from the latter had reached Grindavik<bb>#39;s eastern defence walls.

Lava moving west is heading in the direction of the Blue Lagoon and a geothermal power plant, which provides hot water for most of the Reykjanes Peninsula.
There are concerns that fibre optic cables on the road could be damaged - causing disruption to phone and internet services.
Between 500-600 people in the area when the eruption happened.
The Blue Lagoon is closed until further notice as a precaution.

The last time the Reykjanes Peninsula had a period of volcanic activity was 800 years ago - and the eruptions went on for decades.

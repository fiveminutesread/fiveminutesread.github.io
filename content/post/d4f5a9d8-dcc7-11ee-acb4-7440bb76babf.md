# Hyena shocks Kenyan after sneaking into his shop

Fredrick Omungu found the animal in his shop in the Rift Valley city of Nakuru.
Neighbours came and identified the animal as a hyena, which under certain conditions can attack humans.
It is unclear how the animal ended up in his stall in a populated area.
The hyena is suspected to have strayed from the Lake Nakuru National Park.

Kenya Wildlife Service has been criticised for not doing enough to stop the animals.
In January, a 10-year-old boy was mauled to death on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi.

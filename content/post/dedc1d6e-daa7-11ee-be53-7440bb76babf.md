# Children starving to death in northern Gaza - WHO

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency<bb>'s visits over the weekend to the Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals were the first since early October.
A lack of food resulted in the deaths of 10 children and severe levels of malnutrition, he said.
A sixteenth child died on Sunday at a hospital in the southern city of Rafah.
An estimated 300,000 people are living with little food or clean water in northern Gaza.

The UN warned last week that famine in Gaza was <bb>"almost inevitable<bb>"" The US launched its first airdrop of humanitarian aid into Gaza on Saturday.
Aid agencies have said these drops are an inefficient way of getting supplies to people.
Last week, 112 Palestinians were reportedly killed when large crowds descended on lorries carrying aid while Israeli tanks were present.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN<bb>'s main human rights agency in the Gaza Strip, UNRWA, on Monday accused the Israeli government of trying to eliminate its presence in Gaza.

Israel has long accused different branches of the United Nations, including Unrwa, of bias and even of antisemitism.
More than 30,500 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza since 7 October.
Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and others.

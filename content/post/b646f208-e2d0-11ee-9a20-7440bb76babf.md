# Emma Barnett to join Radio 4's Today programme

Barnett will replace Martha Kearney, who announced she would leave in April.
She will also front documentaries and set piece interviews for the BBC as part of her new role.
Barnett said she was delighted to be joining a programme that occupies such a unique space in British life.
Barnett will join Amol Rajan, Mishal Husain, Justin Webb and Nick Robinson as one of Today<bb>#39;s main presenters.

34;My ambition on the Today programme is to keep asking the questions that listeners want answers to - as well as raising many smiles along the way - while armed with a very strong cup of tea.
Kearney, who joined Today in 2018, announced last month she would leave the programme and front a new nature series on the station.
Anita Rani filled the other presenting position and continues to host the programme on Fridays and Saturdays.
Barnett previously fronted a mid-morning programme BBC Radio 5 Live programme and was part of the presenting line-up of Newsnight.

The legislation is expected to clear the majority of victims in England and Wales by the end of July.
Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to a faulty accounts software called Horizon.
Those wrongly convicted will get an option to settle for £600,000, without the need to bring a formal claim.
Under the law, convictions will be automatically quashed if they are for offences committed between 1996 and 2018.

The law is expected to clear the majority of victims.
Scotland's Justice Secretary Angela Constance said it was 'extremely disappointing' that the legislation would only apply in England and Wales.
Lee Castleton, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was made bankrupt after he lost a two-year legal battle with the Post Office.
His case featured in the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, in which he was played by actor Will Mellor.

So far six former sub-postmasters in Scotland have had their convictions quashed individually through the courts.
Former sub-postmaster Peter Collins, who ran the post office in Grange Park, Blackpool, for 34 years, was told he owed £30,000.
He used his own money to make up the shortfall due to the faulty Horizon IT system.
Then had to borrow £19,000 to cover the shortfall.

He was too embarrassed to tell his family and friends until ITV drama, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, was aired in January this year.
Solicitor Neil Hudgell represents more than 100 sub-postmasters whose convictions have yet to be set aside.
He said many will be owed more than £75,000, and how long will they have to wait?

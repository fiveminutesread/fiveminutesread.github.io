# Ramadan message removed from King's Cross board

Network Rail said the message should not have been displayed on the main train departure board.
Passengers posted photos of the message on social media, along with a mix of complaints and praise for the passage.
Some took to X and complained about the passage, known as a Hadith.
Network Rail said it was investigating why the message was not used.

Humanists UK said it was 'profoundly misjudged' to broadcast hadiths.
They will be writing to the transport secretary to outline their concerns.
Others welcomed the messages, which had been posted on other days of Ramadan at King<bb>#39;s Cross, with The Islam Channel posting to its followers.

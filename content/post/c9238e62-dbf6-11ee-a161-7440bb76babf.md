# Starling murmurations fascinate car park crowd

Thousands of birds have been returning night after night to the Kingfisher Shopping Centre car park in Redditch since January.
Crowds have been flocking to the roof of the shopping centre car park to watch murmurations of starlings.
They have attracted dozens of birdwatchers.
Starlings are in the red category on the RSPB<bb>'s conservation status which means their population is in decline.

Justin thought the Redditch starlings arrived from a roost at Brandon Marsh, a nature reserve more than 30 miles away in Warwickshire.
During the winter months, large numbers of starlings visit Britain from the continent, seeking out the relative warmth of the UK<bb>'s climate.

The murmurations take on incredible shapes in the sky, contracting and expanding as one flock merges into another.

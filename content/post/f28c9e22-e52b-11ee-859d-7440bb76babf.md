# End despair of missing Claudia's family after 15 years of pain, say police

Claudia Lawrence, 35, failed to arrive for work at the University of York in 2009.
Police believe she was murdered, although her body has never been found.
No charges have ever been brought in relation to her disappearance.
Police have asked anyone with information to get in touch and end her family's pain.

Joan Lawrence is selling her daughter<bb>#39;s house in the hope it could be put to good use.
She said it might perhaps be used to help someone who was homeless or who was seeking refuge from abuse.  In 2018, he was appointed an OBE in the Queen<bb>#38;s Birthday Honours in recognition of his campaigning.
Claudia Lawrence would have celebrated her 50th birthday on 27 February.

North Yorkshire Police said the investigation was not closed.
Mr Fox said the single barrier to solving the mystery was the silence of those in the know.
He said if a specific line of inquiry was developed from new information, police would take decisive action.
Claudia Lawrence disappeared 15 years ago.

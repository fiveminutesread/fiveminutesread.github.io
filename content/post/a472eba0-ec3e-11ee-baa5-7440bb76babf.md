# The women behind a fugitive rapist's downfall

Jade Skea was a teenager when she first met charismatic street trader Kim Avis.
She did not know it would bring her into a decade-long, controlling and abusive relationship with him.
Avis was at the centre of a story that involved a fake death plot, an international manhunt and a high court trial.
Avis isolated Jade from family and friends and moved her into a static caravan outside Inverness.

34;We kind of felt like he was one of us.
34;" says Jade of her relationship with Avis.
Avis would subject Jade to a campaign of physical violence and abuse.
He would go on to rape her again at his house known as the <bb>"Wolves<bb>' Den.

Kim Avis was charged with multiple rapes and sexual assaults against four women.
He was released on bail and a trial date was set for March 2019.
Three other women had come forward to tell their stories of how Avis had raped and abused them over decades.
Two of them were children at the time of the abuse.

Avis was reported missing by his eldest son who was with him in the US.
Police recorded reported sightings of Avis all over the California coast in the days following his disappearance.
After a three-day search it became clear the drowning was a hoax and a serial rapist was on the loose.
Avis was last seen in Colorado Springs, 1,300 miles from where she disappeared.

Months later, a mysterious man with an unusual accent arrived at a stall selling rocks and gemstones in the mountains near Colorado Springs.
The man claimed to be Scottish and sported an unfinished giant wolf tattoo across his back.
He would spend about $3,000 at the stall.
Angie no longer believed Cameron MacGregor was who he said he was.

She took a picture of his car licence plates.
The US Marshals now had various tip-offs, sightings and financial transactions in the area too.
They covered every possible escape route for hours while they waited for him to surface.
When he was arrested, Avis had more than $50,000 in cash, plus gold coins.

Angie says they could not release the money and the van back to him.
She ended up selling the van for $20,000 and sent most of the other cash back to Avis.
He says he never got a dime.
After months on the run, an international manhunt, and a media circus, Avis was back home to face justice.

He was convicted of rape and sexual offences against four women in June 2021.
Was jailed for 15 years - 12 years for sex crimes, and three years for failing to appear in court.

# Top civil servant and MI6 boss quit all-male club

Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and MI6 chief Richard Moore quit the Garrick Club.  Mr Case told MPs he joined the club to reform it from within.  The club's membership list was published in the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday.  The Garrick has been contacted for comment.

Mr Case served as private secretary to King Charles, the then-Prince of Wales.  He stepped back from his duties in October because of a medical matter.  Mr Case was appointed Cabinet Secretary by former prime minister Boris Johnson in 2020.  He returned to work in January this year.

The Garrick is an all-male private members institution based in London's West End.  The club has been under pressure to change its rules to allow female members.  This year, members will have a chance to vote again on allowing women amid accusations of elitism and misogyny.  The Garrick was founded in 1831, named after famous eighteenth century actor David Garrick.

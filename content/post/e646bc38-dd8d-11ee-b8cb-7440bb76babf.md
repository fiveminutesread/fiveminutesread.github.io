The six films Things we Love, are produced by Aardman studios and BBC Creative.
The 30-second films include mad hamsters from Port Talbot and a family of foxes from Birmingham who can<bb>'t get enough BBC News, Sport and MasterChef.
Three of the films will be screened on BBC One later.
Families in the films were found through the BBC<bb>'s audience engagement programme which interviews hundreds of people every year on their views about the BBC.

All the dialogue is unscripted and selected from real conversations with members of the public from across the UK.
Producer Danny Gallagher, said narrowing down the material they gather can be a challenge.
The first three films will broadcast on BBC One before The One Show later.
The films will also run in cinema, on You Tube and across social media and will appear across the BBC throughout 2024.

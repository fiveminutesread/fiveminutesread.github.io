# Dragon Ball theme park to be built in Saudi Arabia

The theme park will feature a 70m (229.

It will be the world's first theme park based on the popular Japanese series.
The announcement has been met with criticism for its human rights record.

It comes just weeks after the death of the show's creator, Akira Toriyama.
The Dragon Ball comic series debuted in 1984.
It follows a boy named Son Goku in his quest to collect magical dragon balls.
It is one of the most influential and best-selling Japanese comics of all time.

Only his family and very few friends attended his funeral, according to a statement.

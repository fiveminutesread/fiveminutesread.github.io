# YouTuber Paul to fight ex-champion Tyson

It is unclear if it will be an official fight or an exhibition bout.
It will be staged in Texas and broadcast live on streaming platform Netflix.
Paul, 27, beat Ryan Bourland in his 10th professional fight last Saturday.
Tyson's professional career ended in 2005 and he will turn 58 three weeks before facing Paul.

Tyson was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles in 1987.
His reign as unified champion came to a shock end in 1990 as he was beaten by Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.
Paul has won nine of his 10 boxing fights, mostly against ex-UFC fighters, with his solitary defeat coming in February 2023.

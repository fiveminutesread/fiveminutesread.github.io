# How to get Glastonbury tickets if you missed out

General sale tickets for the event at Worthy Farm in Somerset sold out within an hour in November.
The number of tickets put up for resale depends on how many people do not pay the full amount.
No exact date has been released, but tickets will be available in April.
Twenty tickets are up for grabs and the draw is open until 12:00 GMT on 28 March.

Tickets purchased in the resale must be paid for in full at point of booking.
Organisers urge fans to go through the official channels to avoid being scammed out of their money.
Last year, about two-and-a-half million people sought tickets for the event at Worthy Farm, with just 210,000 available.
Tickets for the 2024 festival cost £355 (plus a £5 booking fee), up from £335 for 2023<bb>#39;s event.

Burna Boy, Little Simz and Keane also feature in this year<bb>#39;s line-up.
Avril Lavigne, Keane, Cyndi Lauper, Anne-Marie, Jessie Ware and Declan McKenna also feature.
More acts are still to be announced, so keep a close eye on the Glastonbury Festival website.

# Council and firm fined over engineer's storm death

Matt Campbell was killed in Slieve Gullion Park in September 2018.
A 200-year-old beech tree was uprooted and crushed him.
amber weather warning was in place in Northern Ireland due to Storm Ali.
Council and construction firm fined a total of Â£50,000.

Mr Campbell had been working for Lagan Construction Ltd as an electrical engineer.
He was finishing up work in the park when he went back to lock up a pumping station.
Newry Mourne and Down District Council had pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to make an appropriate risk assessment.
Judge Paul Ramsey said the conclusion would do little to ease the grief of Mr Campbell's family.

He told the court the family had asked if it was possible that the fines be donated to local charities.
Mr Campbell was a kind, generous, funny and loving young man, the judge said.
Both employers were in receipt of Met Office weather warnings advising of a strengthening storm with the potential to cause danger to life.
Health and Safety Executive NI inspector said: <bb>"This tragic incident needlessly claimed the life of a young man who was working in an area populated with mature trees during a severe weather event.

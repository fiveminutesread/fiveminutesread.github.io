# Banksy tree mural covered in plastic and boards

The artwork in Finsbury Park features swathes of green paint on a residential building behind a nearby tree.  The mural was claimed by the street artist on social media but just days later was strewn with white paint.  Islington council said the plastic and boards had been put up by the building<bb>'s owner, not the council.  GÃ¼ley Polat travelled to see the mural from Germany.

She said: <bb>"It seems like we are in prison.
I think Banksy doesn<bb>'t want to have his street art in a prison.

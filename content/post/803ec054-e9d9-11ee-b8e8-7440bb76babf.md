# Did Russia ignore US 'extremist' attacks warning?

Washington issued a warning to its own citizens on 7 March.
It warned of reports that extremists had plans to target large gatherings.
It specifically mentioned concerts and advised Americans in the city to avoid large gatherings over the coming 48 hours.
It seems clear Washington had some kind of intelligence and that it related to Islamic State.

The US government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its long-standing <bb>'duty to warn policy, a US official said.
Three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the board of Russia's Federal Security Service.
He claimed that Ukraine had switched to what he called <bb>"terrorist tactics.
We do not yet know the exact nature of the warning or how clear it is.

But the US has a vast network of spies in Russia and the Middle East.
It is possible that the warning is part of a larger plan to destabilise the region.
The US is also believed to be monitoring the situation in Ukraine closely.
The branch suspected of the Moscow attack was also linked to one on US forces and civilians at Kabul airport in August 2021.

But if the intelligence that was shared with Russia was credible and specific about IS, then the FSB and Mr Putin might appear to be on the back foot about why they did not take it more seriously.

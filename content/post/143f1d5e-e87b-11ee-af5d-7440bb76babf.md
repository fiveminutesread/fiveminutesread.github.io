# UFC star squares faith with a career in the octagon

Muhammad Mokaev is one of the biggest names in UFC right now.
The 23-year-old is one step closer to a UFC flyweight title opportunity.
He talks to BBC Asian Network about the importance of his faith during Ramadan, a month of spiritual reflection for Muslims.
Mokaev arrived from Russia aged 12, shortly after his mum died.

He first lived in a refugee shelter in Liverpool, before moving to Wigan.
Mokaev: "I think the struggles that happen to me at a young age are the best thing that ever happened to me" In the UK, his PE teacher took him under his wing, something Mokaev is still thankful for today.
34;It<bb>#39;s made me who I am today and anything in my life right now, I<bb>#38;d be ready for it.
I still go and see my PE teacher and we stay in touch all time.

Ankur Desai: "I will do everything.
I<bb>#39;m just gonna fight anyone who the UFC put in front of me.
34;I will fight anyone.
I'll do everything," he says.

I'll do anything.
I will do anything," he adds.

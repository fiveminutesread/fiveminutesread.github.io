# Shapps abandoned Odesa trip over security - MoD

The defence secretary had to scrap his visit to Odesa last week.
UK intelligence reportedly warned Russia had become aware of his travel plans.
Mr Shapps was due to travel to the city a day after a missile hit the city.
Five people were killed in the strike, Ukrainian authorities said.

Mr Shapps was due to meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
But his onward journey to Odesa was cancelled abruptly at the last minute.
Fears surrounding his safety were raised after an intelligence update revealed the Kremlin<bb>#39;s knowledge of it.
Ministry of Defence said Mr Shapps did not make a planned visit to Odesa for security reasons.

RAF plane carrying him between the UK and Poland had its GPS signal jammed.
Latvian foreign minister called on UK and other Nato countries to consider conscription to deter Russia.
In January, the Baltic state bordering Russia re-introduced conscription.
Men aged between 18 and 27 must complete 11 months of military service.

Krisjanis Karins said the UK and other countries should follow Latvia's model.

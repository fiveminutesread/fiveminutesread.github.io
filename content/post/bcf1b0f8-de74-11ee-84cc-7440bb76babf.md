# US, UK and French destroy dozens of Houthi drones

US military said at least 28 uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) were downed over the Red Sea.
Houthis said they had targeted a commercial ship, Propel Fortune, and a number of US destroyers.
No US or coalition military vehicles were damaged and there were no reports of damage from commercial ships.
Houthis have been attacking ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

They say it is a campaign of solidarity with Palestinians during Israel's war in Gaza.
Three sailors were killed - two Filipinos and one Vietnamese - the first fatalities since the Houthis started their attacks.
Vessels using the Red Sea have been diverting around southern Africa rather than using the Suez Canal.
The latest action suggests that despite repeated strikes by the US and UK against sites linked to Houthi activity, there seems to be little sign of the threat to shipping abating.

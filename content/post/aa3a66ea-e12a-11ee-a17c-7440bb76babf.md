# Head disgusted by state of food at his own school

The head of Redbridge Community School has written to parents complaining about the quality of food being served to pupils.
He said he had no control over what was on offer and blamed caterers Chartwells for the poor quality of the food.
The school has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
Mr Ashley also highlighted a pie served during British Pie Week earlier this month which he said was of extremely poor quality.

He added he was <bb>#34;angry and disappointed' at the provision of meals and apologised to parents of the foundation school.
The BBC has asked Chartwells to respond to the claims.

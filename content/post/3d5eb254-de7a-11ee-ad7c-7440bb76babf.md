Bryn Hughes, whose daughter PC Nicola Hughes was killed in an ambush in 2012, has been calling for two years for an award to recognise these sacrifices.
The award is the civilian equivalent of the Elizabeth Cross, which recognises members of the UK armed forces who have died in action or due to a terrorist attack.
His daughter, a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer, was murdered alongside colleague Fiona Bone responding to a bogus 999 call in September 2012.
Mr Hughes said there were times when he found the wait for the government<bb>'s introduction of the posthumous honour confusing and disappointing.

The Elizabeth Emblem will recognise those who tragically lost their lives in public service.
Relatives can apply for the Emblem on the government<bb>'s website.
They will be reviewed by the George Cross Committee and recommendations made via the Prime Minister to the King.
Recipients will receive the award from a senior public representative, such as a chief constable.

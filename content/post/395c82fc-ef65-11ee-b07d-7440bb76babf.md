# Stability at Stormont my priority, says O'Neill

First Minister Michelle O<bb>'Neill said she is determined the devolved assembly and executive will continue to function.
Sinn FÃ©in first minister has also added her voice in a bid to make it feel like business as usual at Stormont.
It comes after Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson resigned after he was charged with rape.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) issued a statement in reaction to social media commentary following the resignation of Sir Jeffrey.

The PSNI statement does not name the former DUP leader but police say they are aware of ongoing commentary on social media platforms.
It follows the arrest and charges of a 61-year-old man in relation to non-recent sexual offences.
The publication of any information which is likely to lead to the identification of victims is a criminal offence.

# Understanding Cancer Treatment: Insights from Prof Mererid Evans and Rhod Gilbert's Journey

Both patients and medical professionals frequently express agreement that cancer treatment is harsh. Renowned oncologist Prof. Mererid Evans of Cardiff's Velindre Cancer Centre discusses the difficulties and developments in cancer treatment via her work and the experiences of her well-known patient, Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert.

## A Journey Through the Treatment of Cancer

Rhod Gilbert's experience with tonsil, throat, tongue, and neck cancer raised awareness of the difficult realities of cancer treatment. Rhod was faced with the intimidating prospect of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment under Prof. Evans' supervision in 2022. As a result, a candid look at the psychological and physical effects of cancer treatment was provided in the Channel 4 documentary "A Pain in the Neck for SU2C."

## Head and Neck Cancer: A Growing Concern

With 12,500 new cases diagnosed each year, head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the UK. Even with new developments in medicine, recovery can still be difficult and accompanied by unpleasant side effects like fatigue, dry mouth, ulcers, and loss of taste.

## The Impact of HPV and Vaccination

Gilbert's cancer was linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV), underscoring the significance of immunization in the fight against cancer. A critical first step in lowering the incidence of cervical cancer was the vaccination of boys against HPV, which was made possible by Prof. Evans's research on cancers linked to HPV.

## Advancements in Treatment: The Pathos Trial

Beyond providing patient care, Prof. Evans is committed to leading clinical trials such as Pathos, which investigate kinder treatments like robotic surgery and reduced dosages of radiation or chemotherapy. These developments seek to reduce adverse effects while enhancing treatment results.

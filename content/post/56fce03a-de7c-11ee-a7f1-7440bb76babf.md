Head and neck cancer is the fourth most common form of cancer in the UK.
About 12,500 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the NHS.
The number is expected to rise as more people are diagnosed with the disease.
It is estimated that one in five new cases of cancer will be treated with chemotherapy.

Prof Evans discovered the comedian<bb>'s treatment was to be to be a few days before it began.
About 4,000 people die from it annually, according to the World Health Organisation.
He says he doesn<bb>"t think he knew before he started how impactful it would be.
Gilbert was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

The side effects are a dry mouth, lack of taste, ulcers that make swallowing very painful and difficult and sometimes requires feeding through a tube in the tummy.
Another particularly significant side effect for a performer is changes to the voice.
Gilbert's cancer was caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) The virus is more commonly associated with cervical cancer.
Gilbert was eventually given the all-clear after a successful radiotherapy treatment.

He said he was worried the treatment could kill his career.
A programme of vaccination for girls against HPV to tackle cervical cancer, given at the age or 12 or 13, was introduced in 2008.
HPV vaccination programme in girls has seen a near 90% reduction in cervical cancer rates in girls who were first vaccinated at 12 or13.
Prof Evans is leading a trial looking at gentler treatments that will be as effective.

The trial, known as Pathos, is using minimally invasive surgery carried out by robotic or laser methods, and lower doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
She said: <bb>"I think it was incredibly brave of him to open up and show honestly what the experience was like for him.
It wasn<bb>'t just the physical, it was the emotional and mental challenge that treatment was for him to get through.
We don<bb>"t often see that side of somebodyâ€™s journey because when they come to clinic we talk about very practical things like swallowing and pain.

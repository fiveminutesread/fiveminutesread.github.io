# Angela Rayner insists she did nothing wrong over house sale

Angela Rayner is also facing questions about whether she paid the right amount of tax on the 2015 sale of her council house.
She said she had received legal advice that no rules were broken.
And she said she would not be making the tax advice public.
But she added that should would hand it over to police or HM Revenue and Customs if required.

Police reassess decision on Rayner allegations.
Rayner says questions over her tax are a <bb>'smear.
It comes after questions from Conservative Party deputy chairman James Daly.
The question of whether she had broken tax rules on the sale of her council house would be a matter for HM Revenue and Customs, rather than the police.

James Daly is the MP for Bury North, while Angela Rayner represents Ashton-Under-Lyne.
The couple separated in 2020 and will not be married again until after the next general election in 2016.
They have been married for 18 years and have two children.

# Explosions hit Odesa as Zelensky meets Greek PM

Ukraine<bb>'s navy says five people were killed.
The BBC has been told no-one from either delegation was hurt.
Russia said it targeted a maritime drone facility in a commercial port area of the city during an attack on Wednesday.
President Zelensky accused Russia of not caring who they target.

Russia's defence ministry said it had attacked a hangar housing drones.
The BBC could not independently verify this claim.
The attack comes after 12 people - including five children - were killed by a Russian drone strike on Odesa on Saturday.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on social media that she strongly condemned the attack.

During their meeting in the city on Wednesday, Mr Zelensky and Mr Mitsoutakis visited the house damaged in the attack.
Two infants less than a year old were among the dead.
Mr Mitsotakis: My presence here reflects the respect of the entire free world for your people.

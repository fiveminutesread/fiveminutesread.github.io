# Attack victims hit out at extremism in open letter

Survivors and relatives of those killed during attacks in London, Manchester and Brussels are among the signatories.
They warn it is irresponsible for politicians to equate extremists with the vast majority of British Muslims who deplore such violence.
It comes as the government prepares to set out a new definition of extremism.
The 57 signatories to the letter include Magen Inon, whose parents were killed by Hamas during the 7 October attacks on Israel.

Rebecca Rigby, whose husband Lee was killed by two men with extremist views outside Woolwich barracks in 2013, and Figen and Stuart Murray whose son Martyn was killed.
Claudia Vince, who survived the 2019 London Bridge attack, and Charlotte Dixon-Sutcliffe, whose partner David was killed in the Brussels Metro bombing in 2016, have also added their names.
We also know where anti-Muslim hate can lead,<bb>" the letter continues.
The letter notes the upcoming fifth anniversary of shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.

Communities Secretary Michael Gove plans to set out a new official definition of extremism that will be used by the government to cut ties or funding to any groups deemed to have crossed the line.
Former Conservative Party leader Michael Howard says some pro-Palestinian events have been organised by extremist organisations.
He says there is no excuse for ignorance.
Howard said he agreed with the suggestion that parts of London had become no-go areas for Jewish people whilst pro- Palestinian marches are taking place.

Lord Howard said the right to protest was a fundamental part of a free society.
He said it was unacceptable that sections of our community think that our streets are no-go areas for them.
The issue of extremism has risen on the political agenda in the aftermath of claims by Lee Anderson, a former Tory deputy chairman, that the mayor of London was controlled by Islamists.

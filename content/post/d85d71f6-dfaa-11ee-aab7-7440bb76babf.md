# Australian teen pleads guilty to UK woman's murder

Emma Lovell, 41, was allegedly stabbed when confronting two intruders in Brisbane on Boxing Day in 2022.
The boys, who cannot legally be named as they were 17 at the time, were each charged with four offences.
The boy who allegedly used the knife in the incident also pleaded guilty to burglary, committing a malicious act, and assault occasioning bodily harm.
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in May.

Mr Lovell was in court on Monday but did not speak to media.
He has previously described his wife as the <bb>"glue<bb>"" that held their household together.
He added that their two daughters - who were 13 and 15 when the alleged attack occurred - were now his main focus.

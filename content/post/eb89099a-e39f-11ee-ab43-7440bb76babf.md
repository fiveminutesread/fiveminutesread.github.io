Producer Richard Kraft has assembled a team of writers and producers for the project titled Willy Fest: A Musical Parody.
The event in February gained notoriety after angry families, who paid up to £35 to attend, demanded their money back.
Kraft is known for producing and directing a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory concert at the famed Hollywood Bowl.
A recent eBay auction of some of the props used has raised more than £2,000 for the UK charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.

The items were passed to Monorail record store after being found outside the warehouse where the event was staged.
The event sparked hilarity and memes on social media and now a horror film inspired by one of its unique characters is supposedly in the works.

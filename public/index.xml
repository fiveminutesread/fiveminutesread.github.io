      <description>Doctors&amp;rsquo; AE safety warnings snubbed by watchdog Aamp;E consultants at Glasgow&amp;rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital wrote to Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) to warn patient safety was being compromised. They offered 18 months worth of evidence of overcrowding and staff shortages to back their claims. But HIS did not ask for this evidence. HIS has issued a &amp;ldquo;sincere and unreserved apology&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; to the consultants and upheld two complaints about the way it handled their whistleblowing letter about patient safety.</description>

      <description>Are Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s days as a global business hub over? Authorities say it will protect the city and ensure stability. Critics are alarmed it will silence all dissent with its closed-door trials. It comes at a time when Beijing&amp;rsquo;s iron grip and US-China tensions were already driving away foreign investors who now have an &amp;ldquo;anywhere but China&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; policy. The emphasis on national security and the danger posed by &amp;ldquo;foreign forces&amp;rsquo; raises the stakes for foreign capital and businesses operating in the city.</description>

Hamas, which won the elections, and Fatah, the biggest political faction, were shooting each other in Gaza. Israel says it is intent on eliminating Hamas as a governing and military force. International eyes have turned towards the PA as the vehicle that might carry Palestinians into a new, united post-war era.</description>

      <description>How do interest rates affect me? Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The base rate, currently 5. 25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

      <description>Is this the worst economic inheritance since WW2? There are certainly problems facing the next government, but other governments in the last 80 years have also faced big economic challenges. Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 at the time of an oil crisis and rapidly-rising prices. The coalition government of 2010 followed a global financial crisis. Net debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is currently at levels last seen in the early 1960s.</description>

Extra help with childcare costs is being rolled out in stages. The help you can get depends on the age of your child, and whether you are working, or receiving certain benefits.</description>

      <description>Heat pumps too expensive, government warned Despite its target, only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK in 2022.

Heating in UK homes produces 18% of the country#39;s greenhouse gas emissions.&#xA;Only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK in 2022.

      <description>Putin: From Russia&amp;rsquo;s KGB to a presidency defined by war Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. As he prepares for a fifth term as president, aged 71, there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036. It was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. He often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato.</description>

Much of it has been created by street artist Vladimir Ovchinnikov.&#xA;Vladimir uses his art to comment on the present, but to shine a light on Russia#39;s dark past - the repressions of the Stalin era.</description>

This could leave the far-right Chega party as kingmaker, although mainstream rivals have vowed to sideline it. The election comes four months after Antonio Costa&amp;rsquo;s resignation as prime minister. Chega won 7% of the vote in the 2022 legislative elections.&#xA;Polls suggest it could now double this score, leaving it potentially able to keep a minority centre-right government in power - at a price.</description>

Pentagon officials accept that their research won&amp;rsquo;t quell popular beliefs about alien visitors. The proliferation of television programmes, books, movies, and the vast amount of internet and social media content centred on UAP-related topics most likely has influenced the public conversation on this topic. Pentagon report says public opinion has been swayed by pop culture.</description>

      <description>Why does International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day matter? International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD) grew out of the labour movement. The seeds were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. The idea to make it an international event came from Clara Zetkin, a communist activist. The 8 March date was chosen after Russian women demanded bread and peace during a war-time strike in 1917.</description>

      <description>Parents on up to £80,000 eligible for child benefit Benefit will not be taken away entirely until an individual earns £80,000. Changes are set to help 170,000 families with children under 16. But the system has been criticised for being unfair to households with one high-earning parent. Under child benefit, parents receive £24 a week for one child and £15.&#xA;90 for each additional child. Under the current system, if one partner earns more than £50,000, child benefit starts being gradually withdrawn.</description>

      <description>Is the tax take the highest for 70 years? The UK economy grew faster than Germany over the past year, but not France or Italy. Mr Hunt is right to say that for the whole period that the Conservatives have been in power, the UK has grown faster than all three of them. But if we look at GDP per person, which excludes the effect of the growing population, Germany has actually performed better than the UK during that period.</description>

      <description>Can the Panama Canal save itself? Unlike the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal is fed by a freshwater lake. The water level is falling critically low. A lack of rain and the El Nino weather phenomenon have contributed to the second driest year in the canal&amp;rsquo;s 110-year history. Last October was the driest month since records began.&#xA;The canal region saw 41% less rainfall than normal. The drought threatens to continue disrupting the $270bn (£213bn) worth of cargo that flows through the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut annually.</description>

A study by Cambridge University in 2022 found that the UK and its flowers are blooming one month earlier than they used to. Gardeners at Kew Gardens in London say it&amp;rsquo;s unusual to have so many species in bloom.</description>

      <description>Medical leaders back rise in physician associates NHS has 3,286 PAs, who assist healthcare teams and are not authorised to prescribe or request scans. British Medical Association (BMA) is concerned about a new law allowing the General Medical Council to regulate PAs. The doctors&amp;rsquo; union says it blurs the lines between doctors and PAs and could risk patient safety. Like PAs, AAs are healthcare professionals who work as part of a multidisciplinary team with supervision from a named senior doctor.</description>

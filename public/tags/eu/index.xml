But post-Brexit, EU countries will not accept passports issued more than 10 years ago. 32 million people had applied for passports that if granted would be over 10 years old. Since the UK left the EU, travellers heading to all countries within the zone must have a passport which was issued less than 10 years before their departure date.</description>

The base rate, currently 5. 25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

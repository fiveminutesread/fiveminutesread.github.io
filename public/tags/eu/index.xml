      <description>Assange judges seek no death penalty pledge from US US authorities say Mr Assange endangered lives by publishing thousands of classified documents. His lawyers have argued that the case is a form of &amp;ldquo;state retaliation. The court adjourned its final decision on Mr Assange&amp;rsquo;s extradition by three weeks to give the US government time to comply with its order. Wikileaks published confidential US documents in 2010 and 2011.&#xA;Mr Assange was widely condemned for failing to redact the names of intelligence operatives.</description>

      <description>Kate rumours linked to Russian disinformation Security researchers believe a Russia-based disinformation group amplified and added to the frenzy of social media conspiracies about the Princess of Wales&amp;rsquo; health. The accounts involved were also spreading content opposing France&amp;rsquo;s backing for Ukraine, suggesting a wider international context for the royal rumours. Royal hashtags were shared billions of times across a range of social media platforms. The BBC had previously tracked down amateur sleuths and real social media users who started and drove speculation and conspiracy theories.</description>

      <description>How do interest rates affect me? Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The base rate, currently 5. 25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

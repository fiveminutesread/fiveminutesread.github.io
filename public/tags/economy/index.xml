      <description>Are Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s days as a global business hub over? Authorities say it will protect the city and ensure stability. Critics are alarmed it will silence all dissent with its closed-door trials. It comes at a time when Beijing&amp;rsquo;s iron grip and US-China tensions were already driving away foreign investors who now have an &amp;ldquo;anywhere but China&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; policy. The emphasis on national security and the danger posed by &amp;ldquo;foreign forces&amp;rsquo; raises the stakes for foreign capital and businesses operating in the city.</description>

      <description>How do interest rates affect me? Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The base rate, currently 5. 25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

      <description>Was this the week Israel and Hezbollah drew closer to war? The day after the Hamas assault, Lebanon#39;s most powerful armed group Hezbollah fired guided rockets and shells into Israel. Israel carried out more air strikes on the Bekaa valley, deep into Lebanon, taking the death toll in Lebanon since the start of the conflict to more than 240. Could Israel, traumatised and vulnerable, with a prime minister fighting for political survival, decide the threat from across its northern border in Lebanon needs to be neutralised?</description>

      <description>Why does International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day matter? International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD) grew out of the labour movement. The seeds were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. The idea to make it an international event came from Clara Zetkin, a communist activist. The 8 March date was chosen after Russian women demanded bread and peace during a war-time strike in 1917.</description>

Mr Biden&amp;rsquo;s approval ratings are some of the lowest recorded for a president seeking re-election. Americans across the political spectrum feel discomfort about giving him another four-years as the commander-in-chief.</description>

      <description>Why Putin&amp;rsquo;s fifth term as Russian leader was never in doubt Kremlin ensured Putin had no credible opponent so it was always certain he would secure a fifth term by a landslide. It was at a grand military awards ceremony last December that Vladimir Putin, 71, told the Russian public he would stand for the presidency again. He said: &amp;ldquo;Now is the time for making decisions. I will be running for the post of president of the Russian Federation&amp;rdquo; Kremlin rarely leaves its choreography to chance.</description>

      <description>Putin: From Russia&amp;rsquo;s KGB to a presidency defined by war Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. As he prepares for a fifth term as president, aged 71, there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036. It was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. He often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato.</description>

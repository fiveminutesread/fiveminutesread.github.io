The iron lung uses a negative pressure system.&#xA;Powered by a motor, its bellows suck air out of the cylinder, creating a vacuum around the patient and forcing the lungs to expand.</description>

In the Cotswolds, locals like Sophie Brown are finding they have been priced out of the property market. Gloucestershire Rural Community Council (GRCC) has been dealing with the problem.&#xA;Holiday lettings and second-home buying had seen many landlords take properties out of the longer-term private rental sector.</description>

      <description>How do interest rates affect me? Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The base rate, currently 5. 25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

      <description>Who gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Working parents in England can apply for 15 hours of free weekly childcare for their two-year-olds.

Extra help with childcare costs is being rolled out in stages. The help you can get depends on the age of your child, and whether you are working, or receiving certain benefits.</description>

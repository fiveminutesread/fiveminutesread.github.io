      <description>Hygiene poverty is a sign of crisis, says charity The Hygiene Bank helps people who cannot afford basic essential toiletries. A new survey found that more than three million people in the UK are thought to be experiencing hygiene poverty. Volunteers at one of the charity&amp;rsquo;s schemes, in Bromley, south-east London, said a school washed pupils&amp;rsquo; clothes. The charity receives donations from the community, which are sorted by volunteers.&#xA;34;It often the first sign that a family is falling into crisis when they can&amp;rsquo;t afford these basic essentials,â€™ she said.</description>

      <description>Revisiting Oasis&amp;rsquo; first tour venues, 30 years on Exactly 30 years ago, a little-known band called Oasis set out on their first headline tour. Mark Davyd was asked to book a gig by a rising Scottish band called Whiteout at his venue in Kent in March 1994. He wasn#39;t keen when he found out that an unfamiliar Mancunian group would also be on the bill. He wanted to put on a local support act instead - but the agent stressed it was a joint headlined tour.</description>

      <description>Is this the worst economic inheritance since WW2?

Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 at the time of an oil crisis and rapidly-rising prices. The coalition government of 2010 followed a global financial crisis. Net debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is currently at levels last seen in the early 1960s.</description>

      <description>Heat pumps too expensive, government warned Despite its target, only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK in 2022. Sales must increase dramatically, said the UK#39;s spending watchdog. To meet UK climate change targets, the government wants to install 600,000 low-carbon heat pumps annually by 2028. Heating in UK homes produces 18% of the country#39;s greenhouse gas emissions.&#xA;Only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK in 2022. National Audit Office (NAO) said ministers were optimistic to think that target could be reached by 2028.</description>

He said: &amp;ldquo;Now is the time for making decisions. I will be running for the post of president of the Russian Federation&amp;rdquo; Kremlin rarely leaves its choreography to chance.</description>

      <description>How fast are prices rising in the UK? Prices in the UK are no longer rising as fast as wages, official figures show. However, inflation of 4% in January was still significantly above the Bank of England#39;s target. This means knock-on effects for interest rates could be significant. Core inflation was 5.&#xA;1% in January, according to the Bank of England. This excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco.</description>

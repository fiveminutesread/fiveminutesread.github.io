The group was set up to counter the growing threat posed by the Islamic State.&#xA;Russian President Vladimir Putin said all four gunmen who carried out the attack have been arrested.</description>

Russia also launched a missile and drone attack on the capital, Kyiv, and the region of Lviv early on Sunday. Officials said their defences had shot down 18 Russian missiles and 25 drones there. The BBC has not been able to verify the Ukrainian claim to have damaged the Russian landing ships.</description>

      <description>Did Russia ignore US &amp;rsquo;extremist&amp;rsquo; attacks warning? Washington issued a warning to its own citizens on 7 March. It warned of reports that extremists had plans to target large gatherings. It specifically mentioned concerts and advised Americans in the city to avoid large gatherings over the coming 48 hours. It seems clear Washington had some kind of intelligence and that it related to Islamic State.&#xA;The US government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its long-standing #39;duty to warn policy, a US official said.</description>

      <description>Bullets, a crush and panic: Moscow concert that became a massacre Some 6,200 tickets had been sold for the concert, but security outside the entrance quickly melted away. The gunmen had just walked across the concourse outside the theatre, opening fire at random, killing and wounding members of the public as they walked in. WARNING: Some of the details of this story are graphic. Four suspects arrested, says Russia - follow events LIVE.</description>

      <description>Million in Ukraine lose power after Russian attack There is no electricity in the second-largest city of Kharkiv. More than 53,000 households in Odesa are without power. At least five people have been reported killed and 14 wounded. Russia said it was revenge for recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.&#xA;The DniproHES in Zaporizhzhia was hit eight times according to Ukrainian officials. Video footage appeared to show the dam on fire, but authorities say there is no threat of an imminent breach.</description>

The biggest attack happened in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar. The attacks come as Russia holds a general election in which President Vladimir Putin is guaranteed to win. In Ukraine, officials reported an overnight barrage of Russian drones and missiles on the port city of Odesa.&#xA;Five drones were downed in different areas while flying towards the capital.</description>

      <description>Putin: From Russia&amp;rsquo;s KGB to a presidency defined by war Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. As he prepares for a fifth term as president, aged 71, there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036. It was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. He often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato.</description>

      <description>Why Macron went from dove to hawk on Russia What came over Emmanuel Macron to turn him from appeaser to warmonger in the matter of Russia and Ukraine? That is the question being asked in chancelleries across Europe, as the French president warms to his new role as the continent#39;s resister-in-chief to Vladimir Putin. How genuine is the new Macron line? Is his refusal to rule out sending troops to Ukraine just another of his surprises - testimony to his insatiable need to cut a diplomatic dash?</description>

      <description>Secret classes to counter Russian brainwashing in occupied Ukraine Nataliia (not her real name) was forced from her home in Melitopol. She felt she would be more useful in territory still controlled by Ukraine. Nataliia didn#39;t just leave her home and relatives behind, she also surrendered her profession, giving up her job of 20 years as a teacher. Ukrainian children are educated in territories occupied by Russia.&#xA;They are taught that Ukraine isn#39;t a real country.</description>

      <description>Steve Rosenberg on Russia&amp;rsquo;s stage-managed election There is almost no sign of the presidential election coming up this weekend. The absence of election preparations mirrors the absence of drama surrounding a stage-managed event. The other thing you can#39;t help noticing in Borovsk is the street art. Much of it has been created by street artist Vladimir Ovchinnikov.&#xA;Vladimir uses his art to comment on the present, but to shine a light on Russia#39;s dark past - the repressions of the Stalin era.</description>

      <description>How fast are prices rising in the UK? Prices in the UK are no longer rising as fast as wages, official figures show. However, inflation of 4% in January was still significantly above the Bank of England#39;s target. This means knock-on effects for interest rates could be significant. Core inflation was 5.&#xA;1% in January, according to the Bank of England. This excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco.</description>

      <description>Occupied Ukraine forced to vote in Putin&amp;rsquo;s election Moscow has launched a wide-ranging campaign telling residents of occupied parts of Ukraine to vote in Russia#39;s presidential election. For the first time, the national vote is taking place over three days (15-17 March), but additional early voting has already begun in four Ukrainian regions: Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. Voting normally starts early in remote parts of Russia, but the procedure has been extended to the four partially occupied regions of Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Ukraine-based groups claim raids into Russia The Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) and Siberian Battalion (SB) posted videos purportedly showing their fighters in Russia. The SVR and an exiled Russian politician claimed two villages were now in control of &amp;ldquo;liberation forces. Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s military denied any involvement in Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s cross-border raids. The Il-76 military-transport plane crashed shortly after take-off.&#xA;The ministry said an engine fire caused the crash. Russia said Ukraine had launched 25 drones on targets across Russia, but the attack was thwarted.</description>

      <description>The Ukrainian sea drones hunting Russian warships Drones have been used to target Russian ships in the past. But the latest attack was the first time they have been seen by the public. The attack was carried out by a group known as the Group-13. It is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.&#xA;The Magura V5, named after a Slavic goddess of war, looks like a small motorboat with a flat surface instead of passenger seats.</description>

Biden draws election battle lines in fiery speech. He calls on Congress to unblock the bill that would release the funding Kyiv needs.</description>

      <description>Swedes cheer end of long wait to join Nato Sweden officially joined Nato following a document handover in Washington. A decade ago a majority of residents were against joining the multinational military alliance. Many Swedes say there is palpable relief that the wait to secure membership in the military alliance is finally over. As Stockholm commuters rushed to work in temperatures of -1C, few were in the mood for a detailed post-mortem.</description>

      <description>Why does International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day matter? International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD) grew out of the labour movement. The seeds were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. The idea to make it an international event came from Clara Zetkin, a communist activist. The 8 March date was chosen after Russian women demanded bread and peace during a war-time strike in 1917.</description>

      <description>Sweden formally joins Nato military alliance Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that unity and solidarity would be Sweden&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;guiding lights. The handover of documents took place at a ceremony two years after Sweden applied to join the military alliance following Russia&amp;rsquo;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg posted on X that Sweden brings with it &amp;ldquo;capable armed forces and a first-class defence industry. Nato will continue to stand for freedom and democracy for generations to come, US President Joe Biden says.</description>

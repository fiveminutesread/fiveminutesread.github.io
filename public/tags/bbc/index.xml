      <description>Parents on up to £80,000 eligible for child benefit Benefit will not be taken away entirely until an individual earns £80,000. Changes are set to help 170,000 families with children under 16. But the system has been criticised for being unfair to households with one high-earning parent. Under child benefit, parents receive £24 a week for one child and £15.&#xA;90 for each additional child. Under the current system, if one partner earns more than £50,000, child benefit starts being gradually withdrawn.</description>

      <description>Is the tax take the highest for 70 years? The UK economy grew faster than Germany over the past year, but not France or Italy. Mr Hunt is right to say that for the whole period that the Conservatives have been in power, the UK has grown faster than all three of them. But if we look at GDP per person, which excludes the effect of the growing population, Germany has actually performed better than the UK during that period.</description>

It has already announced plans to ban disposable vapes, to help cut the number of children vaping.&#xA;Vaping products duty will start in October 2026.

      <description>Starling murmurations fascinate car park crowd Thousands of birds have been returning night after night to the Kingfisher Shopping Centre car park in Redditch since January. Crowds have been flocking to the roof of the shopping centre car park to watch murmurations of starlings. They have attracted dozens of birdwatchers. Starlings are in the red category on the RSPB&amp;rsquo;s conservation status which means their population is in decline.&#xA;Justin thought the Redditch starlings arrived from a roost at Brandon Marsh, a nature reserve more than 30 miles away in Warwickshire.</description>

      <description>Can the Panama Canal save itself? Unlike the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal is fed by a freshwater lake. The water level is falling critically low. A lack of rain and the El Nino weather phenomenon have contributed to the second driest year in the canal&amp;rsquo;s 110-year history. Last October was the driest month since records began.&#xA;The canal region saw 41% less rainfall than normal. The drought threatens to continue disrupting the $270bn (£213bn) worth of cargo that flows through the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut annually.</description>

      <description>Winter warmth brings early blossom across the UK Some blooms have emerged four weeks earlier than usual, according to the National Trust. Scientists say it&amp;rsquo;s part of a broader trend as a result of climate change. A study by Cambridge University in 2022 found that the UK and its flowers are blooming one month earlier than they used to. Gardeners at Kew Gardens in London say it&amp;rsquo;s unusual to have so many species in bloom.</description>

It comes as China struggles to reinvigorate its once-booming economy. Mr Li acknowledged that China&amp;rsquo;s economic performance had faced &amp;ldquo;difficulties. Beijing says that last year the economy grew by 5.&#xA;2%, which even at that level is low for China. Research will be stepped up in new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and life sciences.</description>

      <description>UN says rape likely committed in Hamas attack on Israel Hamas has denied its gunmen sexually assaulted women during the attacks. UN team found reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred in multiple locations during the 7 October attacks. These happened in at least three locations - the Nova music festival site and its surroundings, Road 232, and Kibbutz Re&amp;lsquo;im. Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel on 7 October - killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage.</description>

      <description>Medical leaders back rise in physician associates NHS has 3,286 PAs, who assist healthcare teams and are not authorised to prescribe or request scans. British Medical Association (BMA) is concerned about a new law allowing the General Medical Council to regulate PAs. The doctors&amp;rsquo; union says it blurs the lines between doctors and PAs and could risk patient safety. Like PAs, AAs are healthcare professionals who work as part of a multidisciplinary team with supervision from a named senior doctor.</description>

      <description>Concern as the gambling industry embraces AI Danny Cheetham started visiting local bookies aged 18, gambling on the Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before he transitioned to online games. The ease of access and the solitary nature of online gambling exacerbated his habits, he says. The ethical dilemma here is whether the pursuit of profit is being prioritised.

The theatre&amp;rsquo;s general director, Ihor Touluzov, explains.&#xA;The main stage has been closed off since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2003.</description>

Ministers want to send an unspecified number of asylum seekers to the east African country.</description>

      <description>Top court says states can&amp;rsquo;t ban Trump from ballots Colorado had barred Mr Trump from its Republican primary, arguing he incited the 2021 Capitol riot. The court ruled that only Congress, rather than the states, has that power. Mr Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination and looks likely to face a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in November. Mr Trump said the decision was &amp;lsquo;very well crafted&amp;rsquo; and will bring the country together.</description>

Around 85% of the public supported amending the constitution to protect the right to end a pregnancy.&#xA;It becomes the 25th amendment to modern France&amp;rsquo;s founding document, and the first since 2008.</description>

      <description>Five ways to save on train tickets as fares rise The jump is likely to be unwelcome for rail passengers, adding to the rising cost of living seen in recent years.

Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance.</description>

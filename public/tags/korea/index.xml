      <description>The hidden village just metres from North Korea Gyung-ho lives in the only South Korean village in the Demilitarised Zone. The strip of no-man#39;s land separating North and South Korea is one of the most militarised places on earth. It was created in 1953, after the Korean War, to keep the two armies apart. Freedom Village and Peace Village sit within Korea#39;s Demilitarised Zone.&#xA;They were supposed to signal that the DMZ was temporary and one day soon Korea would be reunified.</description>

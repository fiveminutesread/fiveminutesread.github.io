He was granted asylum after two applications and an appeal. A key factor was his June 2018 baptism at Grange Road Baptist Church in Jarrow. He won asylum in 2020 after proving his conversion to Christianity.&#xA;The letter was sent to the First Tier Tribunal, which handles asylum applications. It was sent eight months after the case was referred to the tribunal.</description>

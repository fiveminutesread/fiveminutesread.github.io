<p>Dolly Parton wrote Jolene and I Will Always Love You back to back in 1973.
The first was a career-defining smash, synonymous with Parton alone.
The second remains one of her lesser-known credits, despite soundtracking love and heartbreak for 50 years.
Dolly Parton wrote I Will Always Love You on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One of the top-rated replies to the post was: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#34;I never realised it was your song.
39; So, after five decades of loving declarations (reciprocated or otherwise), we look at the song&rsquo;s eventful past.
By 1973, Parton wanted to make the stage and TV screens hers alone.
Her first single on that label, a cover of Tom Paxton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s The Last Thing on My Mind, was a duet with Wagoner.</p>
<p>When it made the country top 10 in 1968, it sparked the beginning of a formidable musical partnership.
The next morning, she strode into Wagoner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s office and told him to sit down.
34;I sang the song alone in his office - just me and my guitar.
So I sat down and I wrote this song.</p>
<p>I Will Always Love You&rsquo; Two of Parton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s songs from that rich-veined writing session had both become number one country singles in the US.
She was beginning to make inroads with the mainstream pop audience.
Then Elvis called - he had heard I Will Always Love You and wanted to record a cover.
He said: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#34;You cannot imagine how excited I am about this, and she told him.</p>
<p>The night before the recording session, his notoriously tough manager, Colonel Tom Parker, called Parton and told her Presley wouldn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;t record the song unless she handed over half of the songwriting rights.
Parton forced herself to say no.
This is the greatest thing that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#34;s ever happened to me as a songwriter,&quot; she said.
In 1975, shortly after Parton originally released I Will Always Love You, Lawrence Kasdan penned the screenplay for The Bodyguard.</p>
<p>It took 17 years for the stars to align and for Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston, a real-life pop megastar, to bring the story to the big screen in 1992.
The re-recorded film version once again topped the Billboard country chart,                 a first at the time.
Producer David Foster reworked it into a brooding, ultimately climactic tour de force that let Houston<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s voice run riot.
Whitney Houston told Rolling Stone magazine she thought Parton was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#34;a hell of a writer and aHell of a singer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#38; Dolly Parton and Kevin Costner both recorded versions of the song.</p>
<p>Lee says Parton&rsquo;s version was like a dog hearing a whistle.
Houston<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s version is similarly affecting but delivered on a vastly different scale, says Lee.
Parton was so overwhelmed she had to pull over because she almost wrecked the car.
The song was a mammoth hit worldwide, spending 10 weeks at number one in the UK.</p>
<p>It eventually won record of the year at the 1994 Grammy Awards.
Parton reportedly earned more than $10m (£7m) in royalties from Houston<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;s cover in the 1990s.
The cultural prominence of the song continues to this day, with a theatre performance of The Bodyguard cut short last year due to one audience member singing along too loudly.
Lee says: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#34;I imagine he would have treated it respectfully, layering it with the kind of subtlety and vocal restraint he brought to his covers of songs like Can<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#39;t Help Falling in Love and Unchained Melody.</p>

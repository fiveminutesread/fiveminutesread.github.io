<p>The last time Palestinians had the chance to vote for their national leaders was 18 years ago.
Hamas, which won the elections, and Fatah, the biggest political faction, were shooting each other in Gaza.
Israel says it is intent on eliminating Hamas as a governing and military force.
International eyes have turned towards the PA as the vehicle that might carry Palestinians into a new, united post-war era.</p>
<p>The body is widely seen as corrupt and inefficient, and - by some - as a security enforcer for the Israeli government in the West Bank.
A poll this week suggested that a majority of Palestinians think the PA should be dissolved.
The new prime minister, an economist called Mohammad Mustafa, has been tasked with heading a technocratic interim government.
He must bring together all the Palestinian political factions - including Hamas - to find some sort of consensus around a new unified vision for the future.</p>
<p>Sabri Saidam, a senior Fatah official, told me that the resignation of the government was designed to open up the floor to other factions.
Last month, representatives from Fatah and Hamas sat down in Moscow with other Palestinian factions to discuss a way forward.
It was seen as a positive sign that Hamas backed a statement from that meeting, pledging support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
But that feelgood moment was quickly shattered when Hamas reacted furiously to the appointment of Mr Mustafa.</p>
<p>Hamas has been in talks with the Palestinian Authority (PA) since last week.
The talks are meant to improve relations between the PA and Israel.
The PA has been accused of using the talks as a cover for its own internal problems.
The Palestinian Authority has been criticised for its handling of the crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Marwan Barghouti is serving five life sentences for murder in an Israeli jail.
He is one of few figures who could potentially unite the different Palestinian factions.
His name is likely to be near the top of the list of Palestinian prisoners Hamas would want released in exchange for freeing Israeli hostages held in Gaza.
Mahmoud Abbas has much to fear from his release.</p>
<p>A popular, unifying figure like Barghouti is the last person he wants leading the Palestinians.
To what extent Hamas still holds power in Gaza, after more than five months of war, is complicated and difficult to assess.
Hamas fighters are still confronting Israeli forces across the Gaza Strip.
Most of its top leadership still appear to be free, and Israel says several Hamas battalions remain intact in the southern border town of Rafah.</p>
<p>Even the civilian committees responsible for distributing aid in Gaza City are overwhelmingly affiliated with Hamas.
The chances of them being allowed to openly run candidates in any new elections are virtually zero.
But that doesn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;t change the mood on the ground.
How the war ends - and how strong Hamas remains after it will be key.</p>
<p>The failures of internationally backed peace deals are already partly what drive support for armed groups like Hamas.
For the past two decades, sea-changes in Palestinian politics have been rare - and sometimes violent.
Despite all this, Arab Barghouti is optimistic.
34;We Palestinians don<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;t have the privilege of being hopeless.</p>
<p>And that the world realises we are serious.
Biden treads carefully through Middle East minefield.
Gaza desperately needs more aid but agencies canâ€™t cope.
Hamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoided.</p>
<p>Iran<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become.</p>

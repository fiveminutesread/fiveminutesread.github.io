Labour had planned to raise an extra £2bn by replacing tax breaks for overseas workers. It had also set aside £1.&#xA;6bn to pay for more appointments in the NHS.</description>

Researchers from Cambridge and Cardiff Universities say they are the oldest fossilised trees ever found in Britain. The trees, known as calamophyton, resemble palm trees. Early trees helped shape landscapes and stabilised riverbanks and coastlines hundreds of millions of years ago.</description>

      <description>Medical leaders back rise in physician associates NHS has 3,286 PAs, who assist healthcare teams and are not authorised to prescribe or request scans. British Medical Association (BMA) is concerned about a new law allowing the General Medical Council to regulate PAs. The doctors&amp;rsquo; union says it blurs the lines between doctors and PAs and could risk patient safety. Like PAs, AAs are healthcare professionals who work as part of a multidisciplinary team with supervision from a named senior doctor.</description>

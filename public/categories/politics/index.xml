      <description>Dharshini David: An election giveaway but taxes will still rise Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was on his feet for one hour and five minutes.

      <description>Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Conservative MPs will be hoping that the tax cuts announced in the Budget will please voters. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt cut the main rate of National Insurance for employees from 12% to 10%. Now he&amp;rsquo;s gone further with an additional cut to 8% and he also cut the rate for self-employed people. The latest poll by Ipsos MORI has the Tories down to 20 per cent.</description>

The court ruled that only Congress, rather than the states, has that power. Mr Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination and looks likely to face a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden in November. Mr Trump said the decision was &amp;lsquo;very well crafted&amp;rsquo; and will bring the country together.</description>

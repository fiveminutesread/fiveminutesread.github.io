On a salary of Â£70,000, he was deemed too high an earner. But in Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s Budget, the chancellor raised the income level at which people have to start paying back part of the benefit from Â£50,000 to Â£60,000. Claiming 50% child benefit for two children in 2024-25 would total Â£1,106.</description>

      <description>Parents on up to Â£80,000 eligible for child benefit Benefit will not be taken away entirely until an individual earns Â£80,000. Changes are set to help 170,000 families with children under 16. But the system has been criticised for being unfair to households with one high-earning parent. Under child benefit, parents receive Â£24 a week for one child and Â£15.&#xA;90 for each additional child. Under the current system, if one partner earns more than Â£50,000, child benefit starts being gradually withdrawn.</description>

      <description>What is the new vaping tax and when will it start? Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes. But health experts agree that anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t smoke should not start. The government has said it will introduce a new tax on vaping products. It has already announced plans to ban disposable vapes, to help cut the number of children vaping.&#xA;Vaping products duty will start in October 2026. The duty will be in place until the end of the current fiscal year in October 2015.</description>

      <description>Can the Panama Canal save itself? Unlike the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal is fed by a freshwater lake. The water level is falling critically low. A lack of rain and the El Nino weather phenomenon have contributed to the second driest year in the canal&amp;rsquo;s 110-year history. Last October was the driest month since records began.&#xA;The canal region saw 41% less rainfall than normal. The drought threatens to continue disrupting the $270bn (Â£213bn) worth of cargo that flows through the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut annually.</description>

But peers backed changes to make it easier for judges to challenge this. The bill will continue its passage through the Lords on Wednesday, when opposition peers could inflict further defeats. Ministers want to send an unspecified number of asylum seekers to the east African country.</description>

      <description>Five ways to save on train tickets as fares rise The jump is likely to be unwelcome for rail passengers, adding to the rising cost of living seen in recent years. It comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months. Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets. Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance.</description>

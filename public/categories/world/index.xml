      <description>How do interest rates affect me? Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.

It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%.&#xA;The Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.</description>

      <description>Famine looms in Sudan as civil war survivors tell of killings and rapes Sudan&amp;rsquo;s civil war could trigger the world&amp;rsquo;s largest hunger crisis, say UN officials. Civilians have given graphic accounts of rape, ethnic violence and street executions. There are also fears that a repeat of what the US called genocide 20 years ago may be beginning to unfold. In mid-February, the Sudanese army retook the city - one of three along the River Nile that form Sudan#39;s wider capital, Khartoum.</description>

      <description>Who gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Working parents in England can apply for 15 hours of free weekly childcare for their two-year-olds. The government hopes that extending free childcare to this age group from April 2024 - and to all under-5s in 2025 - will get more parents back to work. Extra help with childcare costs is being rolled out in stages. The help you can get depends on the age of your child, and whether you are working, or receiving certain benefits.</description>

Could Israel, traumatised and vulnerable, with a prime minister fighting for political survival, decide the threat from across its northern border in Lebanon needs to be neutralised?</description>

Much of it has been created by street artist Vladimir Ovchinnikov.&#xA;Vladimir uses his art to comment on the present, but to shine a light on Russia#39;s dark past - the repressions of the Stalin era.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;HMRC gave me £49,000 relief, but wants it back&amp;rsquo; HMRC is reassessing past research and development (Ramp;D) tax relief claims, after underestimating the level of error and fraud over many years. One start-up told the BBC it is being asked to return £49,000. Business groups say the process is being &amp;ldquo;mishandled and is crippling small firms. Optometrist and entrepreneur Mr Patel received the money in 2022 for work during 2020-21 on a potential new lighting product.</description>

      <description>US military ship heading to Gaza to build port The support ship, General Frank S Besson, set sail from a military base in the state of Virginia on Saturday. President Joe Biden said the US would build the floating harbour to help get aid into Gaza by sea. The UN has warned that famine in the Gaza Strip is almost inevitable and children are starving to death. Pentagon has said it could take up to 60 days to build the pier with the help of 1,000 troops - none of whom would go ashore.</description>

      <description>Portugal votes as far right seeks kingmaker role Opinion polls suggest neither the Socialists nor the opposition centre-right is likely to win outright. This could leave the far-right Chega party as kingmaker, although mainstream rivals have vowed to sideline it. The election comes four months after Antonio Costa&amp;rsquo;s resignation as prime minister. Chega won 7% of the vote in the 2022 legislative elections.&#xA;Polls suggest it could now double this score, leaving it potentially able to keep a minority centre-right government in power - at a price.</description>

      <description>The Papers: Gove&amp;rsquo;s extremism warning and Johnson in trip to Venezuela The Sunday Times reports that Boris Johnson flew to Venezuela last month for what it describes as secret talks. There has been concern in western diplomatic circles that Nicolás Maduro might supply weapons or other military support to Russia. Michael Gove warns that some pro-Palestinian events have been organised by extremist organisations. The Mail on Sunday leads on a claim by Earl Spencer in his memoir that he was sexually abused as an 11-year-old by a female member of staff at his boarding school.</description>

Some experts fear it will be used as a barrier, preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes. Others say it is part of an Israeli plan to remain in Gaza beyond the end of current hostilities. The new IDF route is the only one which runs uninterrupted across Gaza.</description>

      <description>US says UFO sightings likely secret military tests Most sightings of UFOs were ordinary objects from Earth, report says. Pentagon officials accept that their research won&amp;rsquo;t quell popular beliefs about alien visitors. The proliferation of television programmes, books, movies, and the vast amount of internet and social media content centred on UAP-related topics most likely has influenced the public conversation on this topic. Pentagon report says public opinion has been swayed by pop culture.</description>

      <description>The Iranian female DJs shaking the dance floor Mixed-sex raves are illegal in Iran but they happen anyway. Some of the female DJs getting the crowds dancing are also breaking taboos. The 1979 Islamic Revolution turned the country&amp;rsquo;s cultural life upside-down. Pop music, deemed non-revolutionary, was banned, so many musicians fled.&#xA;Paramida is a Berlin-based DJ, producer and record label owner. Her mother left Iran because she didn&amp;rsquo;t want her daughter to live in a country where women were treated so badly.</description>

      <description>Why does International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day matter? International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD) grew out of the labour movement. The seeds were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. The idea to make it an international event came from Clara Zetkin, a communist activist. The 8 March date was chosen after Russian women demanded bread and peace during a war-time strike in 1917.</description>

      <description>How are the child benefit rules changing? The government says the changes will help more than half a million families. Only one person can claim child benefit for a child. There is no limit to how many children you can claim for. Child benefit is usually paid into a nominated bank account every four weeks.&#xA;You can find out how much child benefit you may be entitled to by using the government calculator.</description>

      <description>Parents on up to £80,000 eligible for child benefit Benefit will not be taken away entirely until an individual earns £80,000. Changes are set to help 170,000 families with children under 16. But the system has been criticised for being unfair to households with one high-earning parent. Under child benefit, parents receive £24 a week for one child and £15.&#xA;90 for each additional child. Under the current system, if one partner earns more than £50,000, child benefit starts being gradually withdrawn.</description>

      <description>Can the Panama Canal save itself? Unlike the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal is fed by a freshwater lake. The water level is falling critically low. A lack of rain and the El Nino weather phenomenon have contributed to the second driest year in the canal&amp;rsquo;s 110-year history. Last October was the driest month since records began.&#xA;The canal region saw 41% less rainfall than normal. The drought threatens to continue disrupting the $270bn (£213bn) worth of cargo that flows through the Atlantic-Pacific shortcut annually.</description>

      <description>Winter warmth brings early blossom across the UK Some blooms have emerged four weeks earlier than usual, according to the National Trust. Scientists say it&amp;rsquo;s part of a broader trend as a result of climate change. A study by Cambridge University in 2022 found that the UK and its flowers are blooming one month earlier than they used to. Gardeners at Kew Gardens in London say it&amp;rsquo;s unusual to have so many species in bloom.</description>

Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel on 7 October - killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage.</description>

      <description>Government defeated in Lords over Rwanda bill The legislation would deem Rwanda a safe country to send asylum seekers to, in a bid to stop removals being derailed by appeals. But peers backed changes to make it easier for judges to challenge this. The bill will continue its passage through the Lords on Wednesday, when opposition peers could inflict further defeats. Ministers want to send an unspecified number of asylum seekers to the east African country.</description>
